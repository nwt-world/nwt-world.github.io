## 📝 Notes

### 🏙️ Prague and Beyond
Prague dominates most visits and is one of Europe’s most visually impressive cities.
At the same time, it is heavily crowded and tourist-oriented.

Exploring smaller towns and residential neighborhoods gives a more balanced impression of the country.

---

### 🚆 Easy and Compact Travel
The Czech Republic is easy to navigate.

- short distances
- frequent and reliable trains
- no need for a car

This makes it ideal for short trips and relaxed exploration.

---

### 🍺 Everyday Culture
Beer culture is part of daily life rather than a tourist attraction.
Cafés, pubs, and local restaurants are affordable and widely available.

Social life is quieter and more reserved than in southern Europe.

---

### 🌦️ Climate and Seasons
Winters are cold and often grey.
Spring and autumn are generally the most pleasant seasons for city-focused travel.
