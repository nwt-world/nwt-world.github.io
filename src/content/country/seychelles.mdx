## 📝 Notes

### 🏝️ Island Types and Atmosphere
Seychelles follows a calm, slow rhythm of life. Mahé offers the most services and infrastructure, while Praslin and La Digue feel smaller, quieter, and more intimate. Many beaches remain nearly empty, especially early in the morning or outside peak travel seasons. If you value privacy and untouched nature, Seychelles delivers this naturally—without crowds or loud tourism.

---

### 🐢 Wildlife and Nature
Giant tortoises roam freely on several islands, especially in protected areas. Birdlife is diverse, with many endemic species found nowhere else. On Praslin, Vallée de Mai feels more like an ancient forest than a typical tourist site. Snorkeling is consistently rewarding across the archipelago, with clear water and calm, shallow reefs.

---

### 🌤️ Climate and Seasons
The climate is warm throughout the year, with two main seasonal patterns:

- **Drier season (May–September):** slightly cooler, breezy, and well-suited for hiking; the ocean can be rougher.
- **Wetter season (October–April):** calmer seas and better snorkeling conditions, with occasional tropical showers.

---

### 🚤 Getting Around
Island-hopping is an essential part of the Seychelles experience. Travel typically involves:
- ferries between the main islands
- short domestic flights
- boat trips for excursions and nearby islands

---

### 💰 Costs and Practical Notes
Seychelles is an expensive destination. Food, accommodation, and transport are often priced above average due to the islands’ remote location.  Staying in apartments or guesthouses and using public buses on the main islands can significantly reduce overall costs.
Despite the expense, the experience focuses on **nature, quiet beaches, wildlife, and slow island life**, making Seychelles especially rewarding for travelers who value tranquility over entertainment.
