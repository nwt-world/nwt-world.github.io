## 📝 Notes

### 🌍 A Crossroads of Civilizations
Turkey sits at the intersection of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.
This position has shaped its culture, architecture, cuisine, and everyday life.

Ancient ruins, Ottoman mosques, and modern neighborhoods often exist side by side, especially in larger cities.

---

### 🏙️ Cities vs Regions
Istanbul dominates first impressions — busy, dense, and endlessly layered.
Beyond it, Turkey becomes more regional:

- coastal towns with a slower pace
- central plateaus and rural villages
- eastern regions with a very different atmosphere

Exploring beyond major hubs reveals a calmer and more balanced side of the country.

---

### ⚠️ Practical Awareness
Turkey is generally safe but benefits from situational awareness.

- crowds and scams in popular areas
- economic instability can affect prices and services

Understanding local context makes travel significantly smoother.

---

### 💡 Who Will Appreciate Turkey
Turkey is ideal for travelers who value history and culture and appreciate strong value for money.
