## 📝 Notes

### 🌿 Nature and Borneo
Malaysia’s strongest natural experiences are found outside the peninsula.
In Borneo, rainforests, rivers, and wildlife feel genuinely wild, offering a sharp contrast to the country’s modern urban centers.

From Borneo, it is also possible to visit Brunei—a small and unique country that is interesting to see once, even if understated.

---

### 🕌 Culture and Religion
Malaysia is a Muslim-majority country, but generally liberal and tolerant.
Different cultures coexist closely, and religious diversity is part of everyday life.

Travelers rarely feel restricted, and social rules are easy to follow with basic respect.

---

### ✈️ A Strategic Travel Hub
Malaysia is one of the best-connected countries in Southeast Asia.
If you are traveling across the region, there is a high chance you will pass through Kuala Lumpur.
The city is clean, efficient, and international.
Public transport works well, services are reliable, and daily life feels smooth and predictable.

Spending a few extra days exploring Malaysia often turns a simple stopover into a rewarding experience.

---

### 🧠 How Tourism Works Here
Malaysia balances modern urban development with preserved natural regions.
Tourism infrastructure is functional without being over-commercialized.

### 💡 Who This Country Is For
Travelers who want comfort, structure, and access to real wilderness without chaos.
