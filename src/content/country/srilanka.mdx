## 📝 Notes

### 🏯 A Few Strong Highlights
Sri Lanka’s main highlights are concentrated rather than spread out.
Sigiriya stands out as a genuinely powerful site, and the hill-country train routes are among the most scenic in Asia.

Outside these areas, experiences tend to feel repetitive.

---

### 🚆 Transport: A Real Advantage
Public transport is one of Sri Lanka’s strengths.

- extensive bus network
- scenic and affordable train routes
- easy travel between regions without a car

Compared to many island destinations, moving around the country is surprisingly straightforward.

---

### 🏖️ Beaches and Everyday Life
Sri Lanka has very long coastlines, and it is possible to find relaxed beach areas with patience.
However, constant attention from vendors and frequent requests for money make true tranquility difficult to achieve.

If calm and effortless beach life is a priority, other destinations in the region perform better.

---

### ⚠️ Safety and Context
Sri Lanka is generally safe, but its recent history still shapes everyday life.

- past civil war
- terrorist attacks in recent decades
- impact of the 2004 tsunami

Security checks, especially at airports, are stricter than in many neighboring countries.
Wildlife risks such as snakes or crocodiles exist in certain regions and should be taken seriously.

---

### 🧠 Understanding the Background
Sri Lanka’s economic difficulties and social behavior are closely linked to its recent history.
Poverty is visible, and persistent solicitation reflects long-term instability rather than hostility.

Understanding this context helps explain the experience — but it does not eliminate the friction for visitors.

---

### 🧠 How Tourism Works Here
Tourism is often treated as a revenue source rather than a system to improve.

---

### 💡 Who This Country Is For
Travelers targeting specific landmarks who can tolerate constant attention.

### ⚠️ When It’s Not a Good Choice
If you value calm, low-pressure travel, there are better destinations for similar experiences.
