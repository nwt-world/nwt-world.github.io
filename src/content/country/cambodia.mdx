## 📝 Notes

### 🏯 Angkor Wat: The Core Experience
Angkor Wat and the surrounding temple complex are the main reason to visit Cambodia.
The scale, history, and atmosphere of the ruins make it one of the strongest cultural experiences in Southeast Asia.

For most travelers, this alone justifies a visit.

---

### 🌍 Limited Scope Beyond Angkor
Outside Angkor, Cambodia offers fewer highlights compared to its neighbors.

Nature is modest, beach infrastructure is minimal, and travel can feel chaotic at times.
As a result, Cambodia works best as a **short, focused trip** rather than a long exploration.

---

### 🛂 Short Stays and Visa Runs
Cambodia is often used as a convenient stop between Thailand and Vietnam.
Within this niche, the country performs well — simple, affordable, and low-pressure.

---

### 🧠 How Tourism Works Here
Tourism is largely centered around Angkor Wat.
Limited resources and investment restrict development beyond this core attraction.

---

### 💡 Who This Country Is For
Travelers interested in Angkor Wat or a transit stop between other countries.
