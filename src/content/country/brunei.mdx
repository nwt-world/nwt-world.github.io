## 📝 Notes

### 🕰️ A Half-Day Destination
Brunei is best understood as a place to *observe rather than explore*.

Most travelers visit for:
- a few landmarks
- a glimpse into daily life in a wealthy Islamic monarchy

After a few hours, there is little left to do.

---

### 🧠 How Tourism Works Here
Tourism is not a national priority.
The country relies on oil wealth and remains quiet, orderly, and minimally developed for visitors.

### 💡 Who This Country Is For
Travelers already in Malaysian Borneo looking for a calm one-day cultural contrast.
