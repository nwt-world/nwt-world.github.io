## 📝 Notes

### 🌆 A City Best Experienced Briefly
Hong Kong is highly efficient, intense, and visually striking.
It works exceptionally well for short visits, stopovers, or as a transit hub in East Asia.

---

### 🧭 Urban Nature Contrast
Despite its density, Hong Kong offers surprisingly accessible hiking trails and coastal views just minutes from the city center.
These escapes provide balance — but space remains limited.

---

### 💡 Who Will Appreciate Hong Kong
Hong Kong is ideal for travelers who:
- enjoy short, high-intensity city experiences

It is a brief stop, one of Asia’s most impressive cities.
