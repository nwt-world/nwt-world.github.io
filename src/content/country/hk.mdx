## 📝 Notes

### 🌆 A City Best Experienced Briefly
Hong Kong is highly efficient, intense, and visually striking.
It works exceptionally well for short visits, stopovers, or as a transit hub in East Asia.

---

### 🧭 Urban Nature Contrast
Despite its density, Hong Kong offers surprisingly accessible hiking trails and coastal views just minutes from the city center.
These escapes provide balance — but space remains limited.

---

### 🧠 How Tourism Works Here
Hong Kong functions primarily as a global financial and transport hub.
Tourism exists, but the city is optimized for efficiency and short stays.

### 💡 Who This Country Is For
Travelers passing through who want a dense, high-intensity city experience over a few days.
