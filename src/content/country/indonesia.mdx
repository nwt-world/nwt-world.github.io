## 📝 Notes

### 🌋 Nature: World-Class, but Fragmented
Indonesia offers some of the most powerful natural experiences on Earth — but rarely in an easy or comfortable way.

- the most impressive volcanoes are on **Java**, not Bali
- the best marine life is found in **remote regions** such as Raja Ampat
- iconic cruises and island scenery are in **Flores and Komodo**

Reaching these places usually requires careful planning, trusted operators, and flexibility.

---

### 🏝️ Bali: Popular, but Problematic
Bali is often presented as an ideal long-stay destination, especially for remote work.
In practice, it works best as a **short visit** focused on nature and culture.

Common issues include:
- heavy traffic and poor road conditions
- widespread taxi monopolies and scams
- limited public transport
- accommodation prices that do not always match quality
- inconsistent beach cleanliness

For longer stays, daily nuisance tends to outweigh the benefits.

---

### 🚧 Infrastructure and Daily Life
Indonesia’s infrastructure is one of its weakest aspects.

- limited pedestrian space
- chaotic traffic and poor road quality
- unreliable public transport
- heavy dependence on scooters, which is not suitable for everyone

Even much smaller island countries often feel easier to navigate on a daily basis.

---

### ⚠️ Safety and Practical Awareness
Indonesia is not openly dangerous, but it requires attention and caution.

- reports of theft from accommodations do occur
- police corruption is widely acknowledged
- dispute resolution is unreliable

Choosing reputable accommodations and avoiding improvisation is essential.

---

### 🧠 Culture and Historical Context
Indonesia’s cultural depth is undeniable, shaped by religion, tradition, and strong regional identities.

At the same time, parts of today’s social reality are influenced by decades of authoritarian rule during the *New Order* period.
Economic inequality, weak institutions, and informal systems still affect everyday interactions — especially in tourist-heavy areas.

Understanding this context helps set realistic expectations.

---

### 🧠 How Tourism Works Here
Indonesia benefits from exceptional natural appeal and constant tourist demand, especially in Bali.
This reduces pressure to fix structural issues like infrastructure, transport monopolies, and everyday usability.

---

### 💡 Who This Country Is For
Experienced travelers focused on nature and culture who can tolerate daily friction and plan carefully.
