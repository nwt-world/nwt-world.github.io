    <h2>✔️ Pros</h2>
    - one of the most unique wildlife destinations on Earth (lemurs, baobabs, endemic species)  
    - strong “real” nature feeling — not polished, not staged  
    - huge variety: rainforests, dry landscapes, beaches, and islands like Nosy Be  
  </div>
  <div slot="cons">
    <h2>⛔ Cons</h2>
    - difficult logistics, long drives, and limited infrastructure  
    - safety and reliability vary by region; planning matters  
    - travel is slower and more tiring than nearby islands  
  </div>

## 📝 Notes
Madagascar is unique because its nature is truly one-of-a-kind — many species exist only here.
