## 📝 Notes

### 🏖️ Cities, Coasts, and Balance
Spain offers a wide spectrum — from dense cultural cities to quiet coastal towns and rural villages.
Major destinations can feel overcrowded, especially in summer, but stepping slightly away from the main routes often reveals a much calmer and more authentic side of the country.

---

### 🌦️ Climate Considerations
Summers can be extremely hot in inland regions.
Spring and autumn are often the most comfortable periods for exploration, particularly in cities.

---

### 💡 Who Will Appreciate Spain
Spain is ideal for travelers who:
- value culture and everyday life over landmarks alone
- want a balance of cities, beaches, and slower rural areas

It is **not** a quiet destination everywhere — but for diversity, livability, and cultural depth, Spain remains one of Europe’s most rewarding countries.
