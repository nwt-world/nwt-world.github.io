## 📝 Notes

### 🏝️ Local Islands vs Resort Islands
Local (inhabited) islands can be surprisingly affordable compared to resort islands.
They often offer:
- good snorkeling
- local guesthouses
- lower food and transport costs

However, they **lack the privacy, exclusivity, and tranquility** that resorts are known for. Resorts typically provide:
- private beaches
- pristine lagoons
- better marine protection
- significantly higher comfort

For a *classic Maldives* experience, resorts remain unmatched.

### ✈️ Getting to Your Island (Transfers)
Reaching your island usually requires one of the following modes of transportation:
- **Boat transfer** – the cheapest option; works mainly for islands close to Malé. Seas can be rough during the rainy season.
- **Domestic flight + short boat ride** – used for islands near regional airports. More expensive but faster and more reliable than speedboats, with beautiful aerial views of the atolls.
- **Seaplane transfer** – the most scenic and iconic option, but also the most costly. Can be delayed or cancelled during bad weather, especially in monsoon season.

Transfers make up a significant part of the total trip cost—often \$150–\$500+ per person one way.

---

### 🌤️ Best Time to Visit
- **High season:** December–April
  - best weather, calm seas, ideal snorkeling
  - the most expensive months
- **Shoulder season:** May–June and October–November
  - good value, occasional rain
  - fewer tourists; better chances to see manta rays in some regions
- **Monsoon season:** July–September
  - unpredictable weather, rougher seas
  - lower prices but reduced water visibility

---

### 💡 Additional Tips
- Alcohol is available **only** on resort islands or liveaboards.
- Marine life is exceptional; many islands have house reefs accessible directly from the beach.
