## 📝 Notes

### 🦁 Safaris: Iconic but Costly
Tanzania offers some of Africa’s most iconic safari experiences.
Wildlife density and landscapes are exceptional, especially in the Serengeti and Ngorongoro.

However, safaris are **expensive**, often significantly more so than in South Africa, while infrastructure and comfort are generally lower.

---

### 🏝️ Zanzibar: Pleasant, Not Exceptional
Zanzibar is often marketed as a tropical paradise.
In reality, its beaches are enjoyable but do not compete with destinations like the Maldives or Seychelles in terms of calm and tranquility.

It works best as a **short recovery stop** after safaris rather than as a primary beach destination.

---

### ⛰️ Kilimanjaro
Mount Kilimanjaro is a major draw and a unique achievement for many travelers.
Climbing it requires time, preparation, and cost, and is typically done as a guided expedition.

---

### ⚠️ Practical Awareness
Tanzania is a poor country, and this is visible.

- infrastructure is basic
- tourism is tightly controlled in key areas
- solicitation and dependency on tourism are common

Independent travel is possible but rarely easy.

---

### 💡 Who Will Appreciate Tanzania
Tanzania is best suited for travelers who:
- prioritize wildlife and iconic landscapes
- accept high costs for unique nature experiences
- are comfortable with organized tours and limited flexibility

It is **not** a relaxed or budget-friendly destination — but for classic African wildlife, Tanzania remains one of the strongest names on the map.
