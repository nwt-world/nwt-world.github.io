## 📝 Notes

Zimbabwe works best as a **focused gateway destination**, not as a country to explore deeply.

The main hub is **Victoria Falls town**, with easy logistics to:
- Zambia (alternative views of the falls)
- Botswana (Chobe National Park safaris)

Travel is usually **tour-based or pre-arranged**, which fits well with short itineraries centered on outstanding natural highlights rather than urban or cultural exploration.
