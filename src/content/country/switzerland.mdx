## 📝 Notes

### 🏔️ Nature as the Main Attraction
Switzerland’s primary strength is its natural landscape.
The Alps dominate the country visually and culturally, shaping travel experiences around trains, hiking, lakes, and mountain villages.

Few countries combine such dramatic scenery with such careful preservation.

---

### 🚆 Infrastructure and Order
Public transport in Switzerland is among the best in the world.

- punctual trains
- integrated regional networks
- easy access to remote areas

Travel feels effortless, controlled, and reliable.

---

### 💰 Cost Reality
Switzerland is not a budget-friendly destination.

Accommodation, food, transport, and activities are expensive even by European standards.
This makes Switzerland better suited for **short, focused trips** rather than extended travel.

---

### 💡 Who Will Appreciate Switzerland
Switzerland is ideal for travelers who:
- prioritize safety, cleanliness, and order
- value mountain landscapes and outdoor activities
- accept high costs in exchange for quality
