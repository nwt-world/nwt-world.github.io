## 📝 Notes

### 🏺 Cultural Importance vs Daily Reality
Egypt’s historical value is unmatched.
Seeing the pyramids, ancient temples, and tombs is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for many travelers.

At the same time, everyday travel is demanding.
Tourist areas are saturated with vendors, scams, and constant negotiation, which makes calm exploration difficult.

---

### 🤿 The Red Sea Exception
Red Sea resorts operate almost as a separate world.

- excellent snorkeling and diving
- relatively controlled environments
- better organization than most of the country

For many travelers, combining a short cultural visit with time in the Red Sea is the most balanced way to experience Egypt.
