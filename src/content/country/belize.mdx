## 📝 Notes

### 🌊 Marine Focus First
Belize is primarily about the reef and the sea.

The Belize Barrier Reef — part of the Mesoamerican Reef system — is the country’s main draw, with healthy coral, marine life, and well-known dive sites.

Inland areas offer jungle and wildlife, but most travelers prioritize the coast and cayes.

### ⚠️ Safety and Practical Awareness
Belize requires basic awareness.

- certain neighborhoods in Belize City should be avoided  
- tourist islands and marine areas generally feel calmer  
- organized transfers and trusted accommodations are recommended
