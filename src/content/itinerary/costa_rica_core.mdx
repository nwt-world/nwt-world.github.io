## Overview

Costa Rica is one of the easiest countries in Central America for independent travel.  
Infrastructure is relatively strong, tourism is well organized, and distances are manageable.

This itinerary combines:  
- Active volcano landscapes  
- Cloud forest and rainforest wildlife  
- Relaxed Pacific beach time  

**Overall time:** 7–10 days  
**Main focus:** volcanoes, nature, wildlife, beach  
**Best season:** December–April (dry season)  
**Entry airports:** San José (SJO) or Liberia (LIR)  

A rental car makes the route much easier, but shared shuttles and buses are possible.
