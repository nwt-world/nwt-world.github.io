## Overview

The Komodo Islands are one of Indonesia’s most impressive natural regions,
known for **Komodo dragons**, **rugged island landscapes**, and **clear waters**.

The experience is centered around **Labuan Bajo**, the main gateway on Flores island,
from where all trips into **Komodo** begin.

Komodo is best treated as a **short, focused itinerary**:
- 3–5 days total
- carefully planned
- centered on boat travel

      title: 'Getting There – Flights to Labuan Bajo (LBJ)',
      content: `
Labuan Bajo (LBJ) is reached almost exclusively by air.

Main flight options:
• From Bali (DPS) – most common and convenient
• From Jakarta – possible, often with a stop

Flights are limited and prices fluctuate.
Booking in advance is strongly recommended.

Labuan Bajo itself is not the highlight — it is a logistics hub.

    {
      title: 'Labuan Bajo – Base on Flores',
      content: `
Labuan Bajo is a small port town focused on tourism infrastructure.

What to expect:
• Dusty streets and limited walkability
• Rapid development, uneven quality
• Useful as a base, not as a destination

Possible short activities:
• Sunset viewpoints above the harbor
• Short coastal walks
• Rest day before or after a boat trip

Recommended stay on land:
• 1 night before the cruise
• 1 night after (buffer for delays)

    {
      title: 'Option 1 – Multi-Day Komodo Cruise (Recommended)',
      content: `

Typical duration:
• 2–4 nights

What cruises usually include:
• Multiple islands inside Komodo National Park
• Guided walks to see Komodo dragons
• Snorkeling at coral reefs
• Viewpoints and short hikes
• Beaches such as pink-sand shores

This option is strongly recommended for travelers with limited time.

    },
    {
      title: 'Option 2 – Day Trips or On-Site Boat Negotiation',
      content: `
An alternative approach is to stay in Labuan Bajo and organize trips locally.

Variants:
• One-day speedboat tours to Komodo and nearby islands
• Snorkeling-only trips
• Negotiating a boat for multiple days on arrival

Pros:
• Potentially cheaper
• More flexible schedule

Cons:
• Requires time and negotiation
• Variable quality and safety standards
• Risk of missing key sites if boats are full

Recommended only if:
• You have extra days
• You are comfortable negotiating
• You accept uncertainty

    {
      title: 'Core Highlights of the Komodo Experience',
      content: `
Regardless of format, most Komodo itineraries aim to include:

• Komodo dragons – guided walks on Komodo or Rinca islands
• Island viewpoints – short hikes with dramatic panoramas
• Snorkeling – coral reefs with strong currents and rich marine life
• Remote beaches – including pink-sand beaches
• Open sea landscapes – part of the experience itself

This is not a resort destination.
The appeal lies in remoteness and raw nature.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'After Komodo – Where to Go Next',
      content: `
Most travelers return by air.

Common next steps:
• Fly back to Bali
• Continue to Jakarta
• End the Indonesia trip here

There are limited overland options on Flores.
Komodo works best as a self-contained segment.
