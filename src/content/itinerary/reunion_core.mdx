## Overview

Réunion is a compact hiking island with two headline experiences:
- Piton de la Fournaise (active volcano landscapes)
- One cirque day (Cilaos or Salazie) for mountain roads, viewpoints, and short hikes

A 4-night trip works, but volcanic and cirque views depend on visibility.
If you want better chances for clear skies, 6–7 days helps.

**Overall time:** 4–7 days  
**Main focus:** volcano landscapes, cirque viewpoints, short hikes  
**Best season:** May–October (drier, clearer conditions). November–April is warmer but wetter and cyclone-prone.

### Base

For a short trip, use one base that works for both core day trips:
- **Saint-Pierre** (south): easiest access to Piton de la Fournaise road and still workable for cirque day trips
- **Saint-Denis** (north): workable by bus, but longer for the volcano day

If you have a car, either base works. Without a car, Saint-Pierre is usually the most practical.

      title: 'Arrival + light day (no beaches required)',

Arrive at Roland Garros Airport (RUN).

Base transfer:
• With a car: pick up at RUN and drive to Saint-Pierre (allow ~1.5–2 hours depending on traffic)
• Without a car: use Car Jaune buses to reach Saint-Pierre (check the airport-area stop and exact timetable)

Light plan:
• Settle in and keep walking minimal
• If skies are clear, use a nearby viewpoint in the south (easy access, short time commitment)

This day is intentionally low-effort.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Piton de la Fournaise (main volcano day)',
      content: `
This is the core day of the trip. Visibility matters.

With a car:
• Drive early to Pas de Bellecombe (main caldera viewpoints)
• Add short marked walks near the viewpoint if weather is stable
• Optional: Cité du Volcan museum on the way back if clouds reduce visibility at the top

Without a car (two realistic options):
1) Day tour / shared transfer from Saint-Pierre
• Most practical: fixed pickup, no timetable stress, includes main viewpoints

2) Public transport (possible, but only if connections align)
• Mountain access is limited; treat timetables as restrictive and verify locally
• Plan a long day and be ready to switch to Cité du Volcan if visibility is poor

Key note:
• If the summit area is in cloud, do not force it — swap with the cirque day and retry if you have extra days.

    {
      title: 'Cirque day (choose one: Cilaos OR Salazie)',
      content: `
Choose one cirque for a short trip.

Option A — Cilaos:
• Dramatic road, classic mountain-town base
• Best if you want one short hike day with mountain scenery

Option B — Salazie / Hell-Bourg:
• Greener valley scenery and waterfalls
• Best if you prefer viewpoints and calmer walking

With a car:
• Easy full-day loop with stops and short walks

Without a car:
• Pick one cirque and commit to a full day
• Bus travel is slower and schedule-based
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Optional add-ons (only if you have extra days)',
      content: `
Add only if you have 6–7 days or if weather forces changes:

Cité du Volcan:
• Good backup if the volcano day is cloudy

Mafate (roadless):
• Only if you want a hiking-heavy day or an overnight trek

West-coast towns:
• Useful for a change of scenery, not essential for a volcano-focused trip

## Transportation

Car:
- The easiest way to do Réunion in 4–7 days.
- Needed for maximum flexibility on the volcano road and for combining multiple viewpoints in a day.

No car:
- Still possible, but structure must change:
  - Choose a base near your day-tour pickup points (Saint-Pierre works well)
  - Use Car Jaune for intercity moves
  - Use a guided transfer/day tour for Piton de la Fournaise (most reliable)
