## Overview

Java is home to some of the **most impressive volcanic landscapes on Earth**, as well as Indonesia’s most important
historical and cultural sites. At the same time, it is one of the **most logistically demanding regions** in Southeast Asia.

This itinerary is **planning-intensive by design** and strongly favors:
- domestic flights over long overland travel,
- **reputable tours** over improvised transport,
- advance bookings for **every major leg**.

    {
      title: 'Arrival - Jakarta',
      content: `
Jakarta is the main international gateway to Indonesia.
It is a huge, congested megacity and not a major sightseeing destination for most travelers.

What to expect:
• Heavy traffic and long transfers
• Limited walkability
• Good hotels near the airport

Recommended stay: 1 night only.

Purpose:
• Recover from long-haul flight
• Prepare for domestic flight the next day

Logistics:
• Stay close to the airport
• Do not plan city sightseeing unless you have extra days
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Jakarta → Yogyakarta',
      content: `
Fly from Jakarta to Yogyakarta (JOG).
Flights are frequent, inexpensive, and save a full day compared to trains.

Why Yogyakarta:
• Cultural heart of Java
• Best base for Borobudur and Merapi
• Relatively calm and traveler-friendly

Recommended stay: 2–3 nights.

Logistics:
• Book flight in advance
• Arrange hotel pickup if arriving late
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Borobudur – Sunrise & Access',
      content: `
Borobudur is the largest Buddhist temple in the world and one of Indonesia’s key highlights.

How to visit:
• Located ~1–1.5 hours from Yogyakarta
• Independent access is possible, but strongly discouraged

Best option:
• Half-day or sunrise tour from Yogyakarta
• Includes transport, tickets, and timed entry

Important notes:
• Visitor numbers are limited
• Access rules change frequently
• Guides help with temple symbolism and layout

Recommended approach:
• Book a reputable tour in advance
• Sunrise access is usually tour-only
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Mount Merapi – Volcano Views (No Hard Hikes)',
      content: `
Mount Merapi is one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia.

This visit is about **views**, not summit hikes.

How to visit:
• Jeep tours from Yogyakarta or nearby villages
• Visits to lava fields and safe viewpoints

Highlights:
• Dramatic volcanic landscape
• Close-up views of Merapi’s slopes
• Local stories of eruptions

Recommended:
• Guided jeep tour (half day)
• Avoid unregulated operators

No strenuous hiking required.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Yogyakarta → Surabaya – East Java Transfer',
      content: `
To reach East Java, you must reposition to Surabaya.

Options:
• Domestic flight from Yogyakarta (fastest)
• Train to Solo (SOC) + flight to Surabaya (possible but complex)
• Long-distance train (very long, not recommended)

Best option:
• Fly Yogyakarta → Surabaya

Reason:
• Saves time
• Avoids unreliable overland connections

Surabaya itself is a transit city, not a sightseeing stop.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Surabaya → Bromo & Ijen (Organized Volcano Tour)',
      content: `
This is the most critical decision point of the itinerary.

Strong recommendation:
• Book a **reputable multi-day volcano tour** from Surabaya
• Duration: usually 2 nights / 3 days

Route typically includes:
• Bromo – sunrise viewpoints
• Sand Sea and crater area
• Ijen – sulfur lake and (sometimes) blue fire

Why a tour is essential:
• Independent travel involves taxi mafia and scams (especially in Probolinggo)
• Night transfers and sunrise timing are difficult alone
• Tours handle transport, accommodation, permits, and timing

End point:
• Banyuwangi or Bali

Book well in advance with verified reviews.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Optional Extension – Bali (Logical Exit Point)',
      content: `
The Java itinerary naturally ends in Banyuwangi, from where Bali is reached by a short ferry crossing.

At this point, you have two clear options:
- Option 1 – Continue onward travel -- take a **pre-arranged transfer** directly to the airport (DPS)
- Option 2 – Stay in Bali (separate itinerary)

Important notes about Bali:
- **Logistics are complex**: transfers between regions require advance planning
- **Accommodation is significantly more expensive**, while quality often does not match the price
- **Volcano landscapes are less dramatic** than those on Java
- **Beaches may disappoint** travelers expecting pristine or quiet coastal scenery

## Independent travel vs. organized travel

It is technically possible to complete the entire Java route — and Bali — without agencies or organized tours.
However, be prepared for:
- Constant price negotiations (tourist prices often double or triple)
- Very aggressive approaches in transport hubs
- A non-tranquil travel style, especially in busy or remote areas
- Situations where limited transport options allow drivers to set arbitrary prices

In practice, **poorly planned independent travel often costs more** than well-reviewed tours or pre-arranged transfers,
once time, stress, and overpricing are taken into account.

---

## Best season

Java is best visited during:
- **May–September** – drier season, clearer volcano views

Less ideal:
- **November–March** – heavy rains, poor visibility, cancellations

Volcano visibility is highly weather-dependent.
