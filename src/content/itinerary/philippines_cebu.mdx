## Overview

A practical marine life route for the Philippines:
- Cebu for two signature experiences: whale sharks (Oslob) and sardines (Moalboal)
- simple ferry hop to Bohol / Panglao for beaches + day trips

You can fly directly to Cebu and skip Manila.

**Overall time:** 10–14 days  
**Main focus:** sea life, snorkeling, island hopping  
**Best season:** December–May (calmer seas, better visibility)

Route structure:
Cebu City (transit) → Moalboal (base) → Oslob (whale sharks) → Cebu City → Panglao (base)

How to finish the itinerary:
- Panglao (Bohol) has its own airport, so you can fly to Manila (<a href="/itinerary/philippines-luzon-itinerary">Luzon island</a>) for onward international flights or continue within the Philippines.
- Alternatively, take the ferry back to Cebu City and depart from Cebu (CEB).

    {
      title: 'Moalboal (sardines + reef snorkeling)',
      content: `
Base:
• Moalboal / Panagsama

Why go there:
• Sardine run is accessible directly from shore
• Reef snorkeling is easy and repeatable
• Good place to “bank” several water days for better conditions

How to get there:
• CSBT → Ceres bus “Bato via Barili” (most common, frequent)
• ~2.5–3.5 hours
• From Moalboal town market: tricycle to Panagsama (10–15 min)

Recommended stay:
• 4–6 nights
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Moalboal → Oslob (via Bato)',
      content: `
This is the clean public-transport transfer route.

Route:
• Moalboal → Bato (bus)
• Change buses at Bato
• Bato → Oslob (bus along the east coast)

Notes:
• It’s slow but works
• Start earlier in the day to avoid arriving late

What to do in Oslob:
• Short walk along the coast
• Oslob churches (simple, but nice for a few hours)

    },
    {
  title: 'Oslob – Whale sharks + Tumalog Falls',
  content: `
This is the most time-sensitive day of the itinerary and it starts very early.

Whale sharks (how it works in practice):
• High probability of seeing whale sharks due to feeding practice
• The activity is concentrated at one main shoreline area and is extremely popular
• Queues are normal — 1.5–2 hours waiting time is common, even on weekdays
• After check-in, you are assigned to a group
• Small boats take you a few minutes offshore (very close to the coast)
• You get a limited time slot in the water to swim/snorkel near whale sharks

Practical expectations:
• Go as early as possible to reduce waiting and avoid the hottest part of the day
• Bring water, sun protection, and something light to eat (waiting time can be long)
• Keep your plan flexible: the queue timing is the main variable

Tumalog Falls (usually combined):
• After whale sharks, most transfers continue directly to Tumalog Falls
• Scenic, easy access
• Typical stop time is around 1 hour
• This pairing is the standard “Oslob morning” program

Logistics:
• Ask your accommodation to arrange an early transfer for whale sharks + Tumalog
• This avoids figuring out local transport at pre-sunrise hours

Timing:
• The combined program usually takes around half a day
• Next morning: bus back to Cebu City port for the Tagbilaran ferry (less stressful than rushing same day)

## Transportation

Cebu:
- Main tool is the Cebu South Bus Terminal (CSBT)
- Moalboal and Oslob are connected by public buses, but travel is slow; plan daylight transfers

Oslob:
- Whale shark experience requires early start; staying overnight is the simplest way to do it

Bohol:
- Cebu City ↔ Tagbilaran fast ferries are the most predictable Cebu–Bohol connection
- Keep buffer time on ferry days
