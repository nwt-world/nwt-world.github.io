## Overview

This itinerary is a practical “easy Nepal” route: cultural start in Kathmandu Valley, a comfortable base in Pokhara, and short ridge treks with teahouse lodging.

It avoids the long, expensive high-altitude classics (like Everest Base Camp) while still delivering sunrise/sunset Himalayan views when the weather cooperates.

Best season for mountain visibility:
- Late October–November: most reliable clear Himalayan visibility
- March–April: very good, but some days can be hazier

**Overall time:** 8–10 nights  
**Main focus:** low-altitude trekking, sunrise viewpoints, culture  
**Key base:** Pokhara (leave suitcase in hotel, trek with a backpack)

## How the guide + teahouse system works (simple and low-stress)

Guides:
- For many major trekking regions, Nepal’s Tourism Board requires trekkers to be accompanied by a licensed guide and to carry an agency-issued TIMS card (revised provision effective March 31, 2023).
- The relaxed approach is to book a private guide via a Pokhara agency; the guide handles permits and lodge calls.

Teahouses:
- Small lodges along trekking routes, usually with simple private rooms on lower routes (Dhampus/Australian Camp, Panchase), shared bathrooms more common as you go higher.
- Meals are ordered from a menu; food and hot drinks are the main daily costs.
- Electricity/hot showers can be available but may cost extra depending on lodge.

Permits (Annapurna-area foothills):
- You typically need an Annapurna-area permit plus a TIMS card arranged via an agency/guide under the current rule.
- Some conservation-area permits can be handled online through NTNC’s e-permit system (useful reference even if your agency does it).

    {
      title: 'Kathmandu Valley (2 nights)',
      content: `
Base:
• Kathmandu or Patan (Patan is calmer in the evenings)

What to do:
• One Durbar Square area
• One stupa/temple area
• Bhaktapur day trip for a calmer old-town atmosphere

Transport:
• Use hotel-arranged car for day trips (simplest)
• Inside the city, use ride-hailing/taxis rather than trying to optimize buses
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Pokhara (2 nights)',
      content: `
Flight Kathmandu → Pokhara is the most time-efficient transfer (typically ~25 minutes).

Base logic:
• Stay in a hotel in Pokhara throughout trekking days
• Leave suitcase in the hotel and trek with a backpack only

What to do:
• Lakeside walk + Phewa Lake sunset
• One easy viewpoint (World Peace Pagoda or similar)
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Version A: Dhampus / Australian Camp ridge trek (2 trekking nights)',
      content: `
Why it fits:
• Low altitude compared to major treks
• Classic ridge sunrise/sunset views
• Simple teahouse logistics
• No technical hiking

Structure:
• Day 1: transfer to trailhead → 3–5h walk → lodge sunset
• Day 2: sunrise viewpoint → 3–5h walk → lodge
• Day 3: short descent → pickup → back to Pokhara

Logistics:
• Guide can arrange teahouses and request private rooms when available
• This route is popular; in peak season, having the guide call ahead helps
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Pokhara recovery day (1 night)',
      content: `
A practical reset day:
• Shower, laundry, slow lakeside pace
• Optional drive-up sunrise viewpoint (Sarangkot-style) if skies are clear
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Version B add-on: Panchase ridge (2 trekking nights)',
      content: `
Panchase is quieter than the most famous ridge routes and still panoramic on clear days.

Structure:
• Day 1: transfer out of Pokhara → 4–6h walk → lodge sunset
• Day 2: ridge viewpoints in the morning → 4–6h walk → lodge
• Day 3: descend → return to Pokhara

Notes:
• Similar teahouse style to the Dhampus ridge (low altitude, simpler logistics)
• Good if you want more trekking nights without moving into high altitude
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Kathmandu departure buffer (1 night)',
      content: `
Fly back to Kathmandu and keep one buffer night before international departure.

Reason:
• Weather in Nepal can affect flights and visibility
• The buffer night makes the trip less stressful

## Transportation

International arrival:
- Kathmandu (KTM) is the default entry point.

Kathmandu ↔ Pokhara:
- Flight is the most efficient and predictable for a short trip (around 25 minutes).
- Bus exists and is cheaper, but slow and sensitive to road conditions; use it only if you are optimizing budget and have time.

Pokhara → trek trailheads:
- Usually arranged as a private car/van by your guide or agency.
- This keeps logistics simple and avoids guessing local bus connections early in the morning.

---

## Cost planning (rough ranges)

Main cost components:
- Guide cost per day (varies by season and experience)
- Permits and TIMS handling (typically arranged by agency under the current rule)
- Teahouse lodging + food (often the biggest daily spend on trail)

Peak season (late Oct–Nov) increases:
- guide availability pressure
- lodge room competition on popular ridge routes

## Notes

- These treks are designed to keep sleeping altitude relatively low, which reduces AMS risk compared to classic high routes.
- Visibility is the key variable. Keep the volcano/himalaya-view days flexible and prioritize early mornings.
- Booking a guide earlier is recommended for late Oct–Nov, especially if you want private rooms and a calm pace.
