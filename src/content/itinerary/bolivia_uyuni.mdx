**Region:** Southwest Bolivia
**Overall time:** 3–5 days
**Main focus:** salt flats, deserts, volcanoes
**Ranking:** world-class natural highlight
**Best season:** May–October (dry season)

      title: 'Arrival Strategy',
      content: `
There are two realistic ways to enter this itinerary.

Best option (recommended):
• Start in San Pedro de Atacama (Chile)
• Join a 3–4 day 4×4 tour crossing into Bolivia
• Border crossing handled by guides

Why this works:
• Gradual altitude increase
• All logistics included
• Landscapes build progressively

Alternative:
• Arrive in Uyuni by bus or flight from La Paz
• Less ideal due to altitude jump and limited flights

Flying directly to Uyuni is discouraged unless already in La Paz.
