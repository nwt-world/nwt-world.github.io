## Overview

Mauritius is a compact island that works well for a calm trip focused on lagoons, snorkeling, and a few scenic hikes.

A practical way to structure it is with two bases:
- **West / Southwest** (Flic en Flac or Le Morne) for sunsets, coastal drives, Le Morne hike, and Black River Gorges
- **Southeast** (Mahébourg / Blue Bay) for the best easy-access snorkeling and lagoon day trips

**Overall time:** 7–10 days  
**Main focus:** lagoons, snorkeling, light hiking, scenic loops  
**Best season (general):** May–October is drier and often more comfortable; November–April is hotter and more humid, with higher cyclone risk (mainly Jan–Mar)

Notes on planning:
- You can do the island with **public buses**, but it’s slower and less flexible for nature viewpoints.
- A **rental car** makes the southwest and national park days much easier.
- If you don’t drive, use: buses for simple intercity moves + occasional day tours/transfers for the harder parts (Le Morne / Black River Gorges).

      title: 'Base 1: West / Southwest (Flic en Flac or Le Morne)',
      content: `
Why base here:
• Calm lagoon beaches and reliable sunsets
• Best access to Le Morne + Black River Gorges + Chamarel loop

Flic en Flac:
• More restaurants and simple daily logistics
• Good if you want a “walkable base” feeling

Le Morne:
• More dramatic scenery, quieter rhythm
• Better if you want views and early-start hikes

How to move without a car:
• Buses exist, but expect long travel times
• For early starts (Le Morne hike / national park), a pre-arranged transfer or small group excursion is usually more practical
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Le Morne Brabant (big views)',
      content: `
Le Morne is one of the most rewarding viewpoints on the island.

What to expect:
• A real hike (not technical, but steep in parts)
• Best done early morning for cooler temperatures and clearer visibility

How to get there:
• With a car: easiest (you control timing)
• Without a car: go via transfer / excursion (timing matters for heat and clouds)

Good to combine with:
• Lagoon relaxation on the same day (Le Morne area is ideal for a slow afternoon)
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Black River Gorges National Park (forest viewpoints)',
      content: `
Mauritius’ main hiking / forest area.

What to do:
• Viewpoints + short trails (choose based on weather and energy)

How to visit:
• With a car: best for linking viewpoints and trailheads
• Without a car: consider a day tour (otherwise buses + taxis become time-consuming)
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Southwest scenic loop (Chamarel area)',
      content: `
A classic day for scenery and easy stops.

Typical stops:
• Chamarel viewpoints / landscape stops
• Short walks, cafés, and photo points in the southwest

How to visit:
• With a car: best (many quick stops, flexible timing)
• Without a car: day tours are usually easier than trying to stitch buses + taxis

Note:
• This works well as a “lighter day” between hiking and water days
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Boat / snorkeling day from the west',
      content: `
One full water day from the west coast.

Options:
• Catamaran-style day on the lagoon
• Shorter snorkeling-focused trips (more time in water, less time cruising)

How to plan:
• If you want a predictable schedule, pre-book (especially in peak season)
• If you prefer flexibility, decide based on wind/sea conditions once on the island
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Base 2: Southeast (Mahébourg / Blue Bay)',
      content: `
Why move to the southeast:
• Blue Bay is one of the best “easy access” snorkeling zones
• Mahébourg is convenient for early starts and has a calm local vibe

How to move bases:
• With a car: straightforward drive
• Without a car: intercity bus is possible
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Blue Bay Marine Park (snorkeling focus)',
      content: `
Blue Bay is known for coral gardens and clear lagoon water.

How it usually works:
• You start from the public beach area and go out by boat for the best coral sections
• Choose a calm day (wind affects visibility)

Good for:
• Snorkeling
• Easy, low-effort “nature day” close to your base
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Île aux Cerfs (lagoon + beach day)',
      content: `
A classic east-coast lagoon day.

What to expect:
• Beautiful lagoon colors and beach time

How to visit:
• Usually by boat shuttle / excursion from the east
• Works well as a single full-day outing during your southeast base

## Transportation

Public transport can work, but plan with realistic expectations:
- Buses are useful for simple moves between towns, but slow for nature days with multiple stops.
- For Le Morne and Black River Gorges, a rental car (or a dedicated transfer/day tour) saves a lot of time.

---

## Connections

Mauritius is well connected by air, and works well as:
- a standalone 7–10 day trip
- a calm beach + nature segment combined with another destination
