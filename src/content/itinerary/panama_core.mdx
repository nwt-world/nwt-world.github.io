## Overview

Panama is one of the most convenient entry points to Central America, with extensive international connections via Tocumen International Airport (PTY).

It works well as:  
- A compact 5–7 day standalone trip  
- A regional hub before continuing to Costa Rica or Caribbean islands (e.g., Aruba, Belize, and others)  

The country offers:  
- A modern and relatively safe capital      
- Easy access to tropical mountains  
- Both Pacific and Caribbean coast options  

**Overall time:** 5–7 days  
**Main focus:** city + canal, light nature, island or coastal extension  
**Best season:** December–April (dry season)
