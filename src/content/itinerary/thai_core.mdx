## Overview

This itinerary covers the **core travel structure of Thailand**, suitable for both short trips and long stays:

1. **Bangkok** — culture, temples, history, and modern city life
2. **Northern Thailand** — mountains, nature, and a slower rhythm
3. **Beaches & islands** — relaxation, snorkeling, or remote work

Rather than a fixed day-by-day plan, this itinerary is **modular**.
You can extend or shorten each part depending on your total travel time, interests, and budget.

Thailand works equally well for:
- short vacations (7–14 days)
- slow travel (3–6 weeks)
- long stays or remote work (several months)

      content: `
From Bangkok, continue north by:
• Night train
• Long-distance bus
• Domestic flight (fastest)

Northern Thailand offers a different atmosphere:
• Cooler temperatures (especially in winter)
• Mountains, forests, and scenic viewpoints
• Traditional villages and temples
• Slower, more relaxed daily rhythm

Popular activities:
• Temple visits and historic old towns
• Nature walks and mountain viewpoints
• Waterfalls and national parks
• Ethical elephant sanctuaries (research carefully)

Recommended stay: 4–7 days or longer.
Many travelers stay here longer due to the calm pace and lower costs.

      title: 'Beaches & Islands – Choose Your Style',
      content: `
After the north, most travelers head south for the sea.
Thailand offers very different beach experiences depending on location.

Option 1 – Pattaya:
• Close to Bangkok
• Very developed and affordable
• Not ideal for swimming (dirty sea)
• Best beaches are on nearby islands

Option 2 – Phuket:
• Large island with good infrastructure
• Mix of beaches, nightlife, and excursions
• Suitable for both short stays and longer bases
• Easy transport connections

Option 3 – Islands (Koh Samui, Koh Phangan, Koh Tao, etc.):
• Cleaner sea and better snorkeling
• Fewer crowds (depending on island)
• Higher prices and less infrastructure
• Very popular for long stays and remote work

Recommended stay:
• From 3–5 days (short beach break)
• Up to several weeks or months for slow travel

## Best season (important)

Thailand’s climate varies significantly by region.

General guidelines:
- **November–February**: best overall weather (dry, not too hot)
- **March–May**: very hot, especially in cities
- **June–October**: rainy season, but often still very travelable

Regional differences:
- Gulf islands (e.g., Koh Samui) have different rain patterns
- Andaman Sea (Phuket area) is wetter in summer

There is **no single perfect season** — choosing the region matters more than the month.
