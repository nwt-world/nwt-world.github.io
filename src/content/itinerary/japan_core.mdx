## Overview

A 12–14 day Japan itinerary that combines:
- modern Tokyo
- Kyoto for the historical layer
- two very accessible volcano areas (Hakone/Fuji and Aso/Sakurajima)
- optional subtropical island contrast in Okinawa

This route uses public transport for almost everything. A rental car is optional and only useful in rural Kyushu (Aso area) and Okinawa.

**Overall time:** 12–14 days  
**Main focus:** cities, culture, volcano landscapes, short hikes, islands  
**Best season:** October–November (clear air for Fuji, comfortable cities, less humidity); spring also works well

      title: 'Days 1–3 – Tokyo (modern immersion, limited checklist)',
      content: `
Core stops:
• Shinjuku (skyline views)
• Shibuya crossing (short visit)
• Asakusa / Senso-ji early morning
• One modern museum option (teamLab or similar)
• One quiet garden (Shinjuku Gyoen or Rikugien)

Logistics:
• Use IC card (Suica/PASMO) for metro/buses
• Plan mornings early to avoid peak crowds
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Days 4–5 – Hakone or Kawaguchiko (Fuji framing + volcanic valley)',
      content: `
Choose one base:

Option A: Hakone (volcanic valley + transport loop)
• Owakudani steaming valley (volcanic activity without hiking)
• Ropeway + Lake Ashi
• Onsen / ryokan evening

Option B: Kawaguchiko (Fuji Five Lakes viewpoint focus)
• Fuji viewpoints and lakeside walks
• Better for sunrise Fuji photos if skies are clear

Visibility note:
• Fuji is highly weather-dependent. Autumn mornings often have the best clarity.

Transport:
• Hakone works very well without a car (Hakone Freepass loop transport).
• Kawaguchiko is reachable by train/bus; local buses cover main spots.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Days 6–8 – Kyoto (early mornings, low-pressure culture)',
      content: `
Kyoto works best with early starts.

Suggested structure:
• Temples and streets at 7–8 AM (before tour buses)
• Fushimi Inari at sunrise
• Arashiyama bamboo early morning
• Philosopher’s Path (especially in autumn)

Base:
• Higashiyama / Gion side is practical for early walks

Transport:
• City buses + metro; IC card works
• Avoid tight schedules; Kyoto rewards slow mornings
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Days 9–11 – Mount Aso (Kyushu volcano landscape)',
      content: `
Aso is Japan’s most impressive “volcano landscape” without technical hiking.

Logistics (recommended):
• Shinkansen to Shin-Osaka, then fly Osaka → Kumamoto
• From Kumamoto: train/bus to Aso area

Where to stay:
• Kumamoto city (easier logistics)
• Aso countryside / ryokan (more scenic, earlier starts)

What to do:
• Caldera viewpoints and volcanic plateau scenery
• Active crater access if open (restrictions change)
• Short walks on open volcanic terrain

Transport note:
• Public transport works, but a car is helpful for viewpoints and flexible timing.
• If not driving: choose accommodation that can help arrange local transfers or join a small group excursion day.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 12 – Sakurajima (volcano rising from the sea)',
      content: `
Move to Kagoshima, then visit Sakurajima.

What to do:
• Short ferry crossing (very frequent)
• Lava walks / short trails
• Viewpoints over the bay

Why it’s worth it:
• Visually different from Aso (sea + volcano + city skyline)

Transport:
• Ferry runs frequently and is easy to use without a car.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Days 13–14 – Optional Okinawa (subtropical contrast)',
      content: `
If you want a final “islands” segment, fly to Okinawa.

Best for:
• Snorkeling
• Warm water (late Oct–early Nov can still be swimmable)
• Scenic coastline and relaxed pace

Transport:
• Public transport exists, but a rental car makes Okinawa much easier.
• If not driving: base near Naha + choose day tours for snorkeling.

This extension is optional. The main itinerary works well without it.

## Transportation

IC cards:
- Use Suica or PASMO for most city transport (Tokyo/Kyoto and many other areas).

Long-distance:
- Tokyo → Kansai is easiest by Shinkansen.
- Kansai → Kyushu volcano segment is easiest with a domestic flight to Kumamoto (time-saving).
- Kagoshima ferry to Sakurajima is frequent and simple.

JR Pass:
- Not automatically worth it. Price is high; calculate based on your exact long-distance legs and Shinkansen usage.

Car:
- Not needed for Tokyo/Kyoto/Hakone.
- Helpful (not mandatory) in Aso for viewpoints.
- Strongly recommended in Okinawa unless you plan to rely on tours.

## Notes

- Fuji, Aso crater access, and high viewpoints are weather-dependent; keep your schedule flexible.
- For Kyoto and Tokyo, early mornings are the simplest way to avoid crowds without adding extra days.
