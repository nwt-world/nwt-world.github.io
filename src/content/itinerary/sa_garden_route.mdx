## Overview

This itinerary combines two of South Africa’s most iconic experiences:

- a **self-driven Garden Route road trip** from Port Elizabeth (Gqeberha) to Cape Town
- a **classic safari in Kruger National Park**

It is designed for travelers who enjoy **independent travel, dramatic landscapes, wildlife, and long scenic drives**.
A **rental car is essential** for the Garden Route — without it, the itinerary does not make much sense.

The route can be adapted to trips from **12–14 days** up to **3 weeks**, depending on how much time you spend in Cape Town and Kruger.
