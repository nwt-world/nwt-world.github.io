## Overview

A South Africa “core highlights” route combining:
- Kruger National Park (2–4 nights safari)
- Garden Route self-drive from Gqeberha → Cape Town (7–10 days)
- Cape Town as the final base (3–5 nights)

This itinerary is built around two transport modes:
- domestic flights for Kruger positioning
- a rental car for the Garden Route

**Overall time:** 12–18 days (works as 12–14 days if you keep Cape Town and Kruger compact)

Best season logic:
- Garden Route + Cape Town: October–April (warmer coast, longer days)
- Kruger: May–September (dry season, easier wildlife viewing)
- Whales (Hermanus): July–October

---

## Logistics rules

Garden Route:
- A rental car is required. Public transport does not work well for the stops and pacing.

Kruger:
- Self-drive inside the park is normal and straightforward, but you still need flights + transfers to reach the park area.
- Kruger is a malaria-risk area. Use mosquito precautions.

Flight structure (recommended):
- Fly into Johannesburg (JNB)
- Do Kruger first
- Fly to Gqeberha (PLZ) to start the road trip
- Finish in Cape Town (CPT) and fly out from there (or connect back to JNB if needed)

If your international flights are round-trip JNB:
- Add Cape Town → Johannesburg flight at the end.

  days={[
    {
      title: 'Johannesburg → Kruger National Park (2–4 nights)',
      content: `
Arrive in Johannesburg (JNB). Keep the city segment minimal.

Optional short stop (only if you have time):
• Apartheid Museum or Nelson Mandela Square (daytime only)

How to reach Kruger:
• Fly to Skukuza (SZK), Nelspruit / Kruger Mpumalanga (MQP), or Hoedspruit (HDS), then transfer to your camp/lodge
• Driving from Johannesburg is possible, but it’s a long day and not ideal for first-time visitors

Where to stay (simple approach):
• Choose 1–2 SANParks rest camps and stay put (do not move every day)
• Book accommodation early in peak months via SANParks online bookings

Safari structure:
• Self-drive at sunrise and late afternoon is the main value
• Guided drives are useful for night drives (self-drive is not allowed at night)

Timing rule:
• Gate entry/exit times change by month. Plan your day around official gate hours.

    {
      title: 'Fly to Gqeberha (Port Elizabeth) → Addo Elephant National Park (1–2 nights)',
      content: `
After Kruger:
• Fly back to Johannesburg, then fly to Gqeberha (PLZ)

Pick up rental car at PLZ (one-way drop-off in Cape Town is common).

Drive:
• PLZ → Addo Main Camp (~1 hour / ~70 km)

Why Addo:
• Easy, low-stress self-drive safari
• Very strong elephant viewing; also buffalo, zebra, warthog, antelope

Where to stay:
• Inside the park (SANParks Addo Main Camp) or nearby lodges

Optional:
• SANParks guided drives exist and need advance booking in busy periods.

    },
    {
      title: 'Addo → Tsitsikamma (Storms River) (1 night)',
      content: `
Drive:
• Addo → Tsitsikamma / Storms River (~3.5–4 hours / ~300 km)

Core stops:

    {
      title: 'Tsitsikamma → Plettenberg Bay → Knysna (1 night)',
      content: `
Drive:
• Storms River → Plettenberg Bay (~1 hour / ~85 km)
• Plettenberg Bay → Knysna (~30 minutes)

Why stop:
• Robberg Nature Reserve is one of the best coastal hikes in South Africa (choose a loop that fits your time)

Where to stay:
• Knysna (most practical) or Plettenberg Bay (if you prefer the beach-town feel)

Optional:

`
    },
    {
      title: 'Knysna → Wilderness (1 night)',
      content: `
Drive:
• Knysna → Wilderness (~45 minutes)

Why Wilderness:
• One of the calmest Garden Route stops (lakes, rivers, quiet beaches)

What to do:
• Short trails and viewpoints in the Wilderness section of the Garden Route National Park
• Canoeing is a good low-effort option if conditions are calm (rentals are typically arranged locally / via SANParks camps)

Where to stay:
• Wilderness (quiet) or George (bigger town, more accommodation)
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Wilderness → Oudtshoorn (Little Karoo) (1 night)',
      content: `
Drive:
• Wilderness → Oudtshoorn via Outeniqua Pass (~1.5–2 hours / ~120 km)

Why go inland:
• Contrast day: coast → semi-desert landscapes

Core stop:
• Cango Caves (book ahead in peak season)

Optional:
• Ostrich farms / wildlife ranches (only if you are interested; not essential)

Where to stay:
• Oudtshoorn
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Oudtshoorn → Mossel Bay → Cape Agulhas (1 night)',
      content: `
Drive:
• Oudtshoorn → Mossel Bay (~1 hour / ~90 km)
• Mossel Bay → Cape Agulhas (~4–5 hours / ~350 km total day)

Stops:
• Mossel Bay: Cape St Blaize lighthouse/trail (short coastal walk)

Cape Agulhas:
• Southernmost point of Africa

Where to stay:
• L’Agulhas / Struisbaai area
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Cape Agulhas → Hermanus (1–2 nights)',
      content: `
Drive:
• Cape Agulhas → Hermanus (scenic coastal routing, timing depends on stops)

Why Hermanus:
• Cliff Path is the key experience (easy walking, ocean views)
• Strongest whale watching season is typically July–October

Where to stay:
• Hermanus (walkable for the cliff path)

Optional:
• Boat-based whale watching (seasonal)

`
    },
    {
      title: 'Hermanus → Stony Point penguins → Stellenbosch (1 night)',
      content: `
Drive:
• Hermanus → Stellenbosch (~1.5 hours / ~120 km, longer with stops)

Recommended stop:

`
    },
    {
      title: 'Stellenbosch → Cape Town (3–5 nights)',
      content: `
Drive:
• Stellenbosch → Cape Town (~1 hour)

Cape Town works best as a “views + peninsula” base.

Core picks (choose based on weather):
• Table Mountain (cableway is the simplest option; book/plan around wind closures)
• Cape Point / Cape of Good Hope (day trip within Table Mountain National Park)
• Chapman’s Peak Drive (toll road, best in clear weather)
• Robben Island (book tour ahead; weather can cancel ferries)

Where to stay (practical areas):
• City Bowl, Gardens, Green Point, Sea Point, V&A Waterfront area

Transport:
• Uber works well for city evenings
• Use the car for peninsula day trips, but do not leave valuables visible in parked cars

## Connections

- <a href="/itinerary/victoria-falls">Victoria Falls</a> (a short flight from Cape Town or Johannesburg)
- <a href="/itinerary/mauritius-core">Mauritius</a> (for island extension)


## Extensions & variations

- Reverse direction (Cape Town → Garden Route → Gqeberha) also works.
- If you want fewer driving days: skip Mossel Bay or shorten the inland Oudtshoorn segment.
- If you want a more wildlife-heavy version: add one extra Kruger night rather than extra small stops on the road trip.
