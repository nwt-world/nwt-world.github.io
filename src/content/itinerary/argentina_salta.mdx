## Overview

Salta + Jujuy is one of Argentina’s best hidden-gem regions: surreal landscapes, strong culture, and very good value.
It’s usually cheaper than Patagonia and easier logistically than ultra-remote high-altitude routes
(like Seismiles in <a href="/itinerary/argentina-catamarca">Catamarca</a>).

This itinerary is tour-based and works well without a car:
- day tours from Salta for the Salta-side routes
- a base shift to the Quebrada de Humahuaca (Jujuy) for the high-Andes days

Altitude gain is gradual if you follow the order below.

**Provinces:** Salta, Jujuy  
**Overall time:** 7–9 days  
**Main focus:** landscapes, viewpoints, photography, small Andean towns  
**Best season:** April–November (drier, clearer)

      title: 'Salta base: arrival + city',
      content: `
Altitude:
• Salta is around 1,200 m (good starting altitude)

Why base here:
• Best flight/bus gateway for the region
• Most day tours for Cafayate / Los Cardones depart from here
• Easy first days before going higher

In the city (compact, easy):
• Plaza 9 de Julio + cathedral area
• Cerro San Bernardo (cable car viewpoint)
• MAAM museum if you want one indoor cultural highlight

Tour booking:
• Many tours can be arranged 1–2 days ahead; book earlier in peak weeks

Recommended stay:
• 3–4 nights
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Quebrada de las Conchas (Cafayate route)',
      content: `
Altitude:
• Mostly around 1,600 m (easy continuation after Salta)

What to see:
• Red rock formations and desert scenery on Ruta 68
• Many quick stops and short walks (no hard hiking required)

How to do it without a car:
• Full-day tour from Salta is the standard format
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Parque Nacional Los Cardones (often combined with Cachi)',
      content: `
Altitude:
• Around 3,000 m in the high plateau sections (first “real altitude” day)

Why it’s worth it:
• Massive cactus fields and open high-Andes scenery
• One of the strongest landscape days in Salta province

How to do it without a car:
• Full-day tour from Salta (multiple stops, long distances)

Timing note:
• Best with clear skies.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Tren a las Nubes (optional)',
      content: `
A niche, touristic add-on. Worth considering only if you specifically want the “high-altitude train” experience.

How it usually works:
• Long overland transfer from Salta to the high plateau
• Then a relatively short train segment at high altitude (the “iconic” part)
• Return the same day (long day overall)

Altitude:
• Up to around 4,200 m (very high)

Why you might skip it:
• Expensive compared to other Salta/Jujuy day trips
• Views are not necessarily better than the region’s road-based landscape tours
• Can feel crowded and schedule-driven
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Base shift to Jujuy (Quebrada de Humahuaca base)',
      content: `
Move north from Salta by long-distance bus.

Where to base (start with one of these two):
• San Salvador de Jujuy (≈1,300 m): easiest logistics and lower-altitude nights
• Purmamarca (≈2,400 m): scenic base, best access point for Salinas Grandes day trips

Other base options:
• Tilcara (≈2,465 m): practical base for the Quebrada corridor
• Humahuaca (≈2,940 m): best positioning for early starts to Hornocal, but higher nights

Why shift base:
• Salinas Grandes and Hornocal are long day trips from Salta
• Staying in the Quebrada makes the high-altitude days shorter and calmer

Tren Solar de la Quebrada (optional, new and modern):
• Scenic train connecting Volcán, Tumbaya, Purmamarca, Maimará and Tilcara
• Useful for Purmamarca ↔ Tilcara if the timetable fits your day
• Not a replacement for Salinas Grandes or Hornocal logistics

Recommended stay:
• 3–4 nights in the Quebrada region
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Salinas Grandes',
      content: `
Altitude:
• Salinas Grandes around 3,400 m
• The road reaches higher points (Cuesta de Lipán)

Why it’s worth it:
• One of the most surreal “white landscape” days in Argentina
• Best with stable weather and good visibility

How to do it without a car:
• Full-day tours from Purmamarca are the most practical option
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Humahuaca + Hornocal (Hill of 14 Colors)',
      content: `
Altitude:
• Hornocal viewpoint is around 4,350 m (highest point of the itinerary)

How it usually works:
• Final road is rough; tours use appropriate vehicles
• Time at the viewpoint is limited (often ~1 hour) due to altitude and wind

How to do it without a car:
• Half-day/full-day excursions from Humahuaca/Purmamarca are common

This is one of the strongest viewpoints in Argentina.

## Altitude

The sequence above is designed as a gradual climb:
- Salta (~1,200 m)
- Quebrada de las Conchas (~1,600 m)
- Los Cardones (~3,000 m)
- Purmamarca/Tilcara (~2,400–2,500 m)
- Salinas Grandes (~3,400 m, short exposure)
- Hornocal (~4,350 m, short exposure)

Practical behavior:
- go slower on the high days
- drink water
- avoid alcohol before Salinas/Hornocal

---

## Connections

- Salta has good flight connections within Argentina (<a href="/itinerary/argentina-iguazu">Iguazú</a>, <a href="/itinerary/argentina-mendoza">Mendoza</a>, <a href="/itinerary/argentina-cordoba">Córdoba</a>)
- Jujuy is a practical exit point if you want to finish in the north

International extensions (logistics vary):
- Atacama (Chile) from the Jujuy/Quebrada region is possible as a multi-day transfer
- Bolivia routes exist; see <a href="/itinerary/bolivia-uyuni-altiplano">Uyuni</a>
