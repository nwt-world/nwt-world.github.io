  days={[
    {
      title: 'Day 1 – Ponta Delgada (easy day)',
      content: `
Walk the historic center and waterfront.

Soft activity option:
• Gruta do Carvão lava tunnel (guided visits; check tour times and booking)

Logistics:
• No car needed
• Everything is walkable or a short taxi ride
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 2 – Sete Cidades (west caldera lakes)',
      content: `
Best use of a tour day.

Why:
• Viewpoints are spread out
• Bus schedules are limited and not designed for flexible viewpoint stops

What to do:
• Vista do Rei viewpoint area
• Caldera lake views + short easy walks
• Optional lake shore stop if weather is clear

Alternatives:
• Bus is possible but plan strictly around the timetable and expect low frequency
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 3 – Furnas (geothermal valley + hot springs)',
      content: `
Most “Azores unique” day: geothermal landscape plus thermal bathing.

Pick 2–3:
• Furnas fumaroles / geothermal area
• Terra Nostra garden + thermal pool
• Evening soak at Poça da Dona Beija

Logistics:
• Easiest as a small-group day tour
• If you want to DIY: bus + taxi combo works, but requires schedule discipline
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 4 – Whale & dolphin watching (half day) + slow afternoon',
      content: `
Boat tour from Ponta Delgada marina.

Season note:
• Spring is often the strongest period (April–May commonly highlighted)

Afternoon:
• Keep it light: viewpoints near town, rest, or a short coast walk
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 5 – North coast slow day',
      content: `
Car-free friendly day using buses + walking.

Idea:
• Ribeira Grande town + coastline
• Tea plantation area (Gorreana is a common stop)
• Short coastal viewpoints and beach stops

Logistics:
• Use the bus app and keep buffer time
• Treat timetables as indicative and verify locally if possible
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 6 – Lagoa do Fogo (weather window day)',
      content: `
One of the most iconic crater-lake viewpoints.

Why it needs flexibility:
• Cloud/fog can hide the lake even when the coast is sunny

Best options:
• Half-day or full-day tour (often includes backup stops)
• Optional “car day”: rent a small car just for today for maximum timing flexibility

Important seasonal note:
• In summer, access rules can change and a shuttle system may be used to control traffic. Check official updates close to your dates.

## Transportation

Public buses:
- Useful for town-to-town and coast days.
- Schedules can be infrequent and can change; treat published timetables as indicative.

Tours:
- Best value for viewpoint-heavy days (Sete Cidades, Furnas, Lagoa do Fogo).
- For calm pacing, choose small-group tours rather than large bus tours.

Car rental:
- Not required for this itinerary.
- Best compromise for flexibility: rent for 2–3 days only (e.g., Lagoa do Fogo + repeat day).
