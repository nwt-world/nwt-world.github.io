## Overview

This itinerary is built around **Raja Ampat**, one of the best snorkeling and diving regions on Earth.
It is a **destination-focused marine expedition**, not a classic multi-stop sightseeing route.

The trip can be done in two ways:
- **Directly** via Jakarta → Sorong → Raja Ampat
- **With an optional marine extension** via Manado (North Sulawesi)

Key characteristics:
- Sea and snorkeling focused
- Remote and logistically sensitive
- Significantly more expensive than most of Indonesia
- Requires advance planning

This itinerary does **not** connect with Bali and should be treated as a **separate Indonesia trip**.

      content: `
This optional step adds a second world-class marine area before Raja Ampat.

How to get there:

Why consider Manado:
• Better infrastructure than Raja Ampat
• Easier logistics and lower costs
• Excellent snorkeling and diving nearby

Main highlight:
• Bunaken – famous for coral walls and biodiversity

Recommended stay:
• 2–3 days

This stop is optional and works best for travelers who want to maximize time in the water
without adding cultural or inland complexity.

      title: 'Manado → Sorong (or Jakarta → Sorong)',
      content: `

• Flight schedules are limited
• Delays are possible
• Always plan buffer time

Recommended:
• Overnight stay in Sorong before heading to Raja Ampat

    {
      title: 'Sorong → Raja Ampat',
      content: `
From Sorong, continue by boat into the Raja Ampat archipelago.

How to get there:

    {
      title: 'Raja Ampat – Snorkeling & Island Landscapes',
      content: `
Raja Ampat is the core of this itinerary.

What to expect:
• Remote islands with minimal infrastructure
• Boat-based daily activities
• Exceptional coral reefs and marine life

Typical activities:
• Snorkeling directly from boats or shore
• Island hopping between limestone islets
• Viewpoints over turquoise lagoons
• Quiet evenings with limited connectivity

Recommended stay:
• 4–7 nights (minimum)

Accommodation types:
• Eco-resorts
• Homestays (basic but immersive)

This is not a resort holiday.
Comfort is secondary to location and access to reefs.
`

    {
      title: 'Return – Raja Ampat → Sorong → Jakarta',
      content: `
Depart Raja Ampat by boat back to Sorong.

From Sorong:
• Fly to Jakarta
• Or continue onward to another Indonesian region (rare and complex)

Always allow buffer time:
• Weather and sea conditions can affect schedules
• Missed connections are difficult to resolve in remote areas

## Cost & logistics (very important)

- Raja Ampat is **one of the most expensive destinations in Indonesia**
- Main cost drivers:
  - Flights to Sorong
  - Boat transfers
  - Accommodation
  - Park permits
- Food and logistics are limited and priced accordingly

This is **not a budget destination**, even by Indonesian standards.

---

## Best season

Best time to visit:
- **October–April** – calmer seas and good visibility

Less ideal:
- **June–August** – rougher seas in some areas
- Weather conditions vary by location within the archipelago

Marine conditions matter more than air temperature.

---

## Who this itinerary is for

- Snorkeling and diving enthusiasts
- Travelers comfortable with remote locations
- Visitors who prioritize **quality of nature over comfort**
- Those willing to plan carefully and spend more for access

Raja Ampat is not about variety or movement —
it is about **staying in one extraordinary place and letting it unfold slowly**.

---

### Summary (important framing)

- Raja Ampat works best as a **standalone expedition**
- Manado / Bunaken is the **only logical extension**
- This route is **marine-focused, remote, and expensive**
- It does not combine well with Bali or Java itineraries
