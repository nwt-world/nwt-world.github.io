## Overview

A high-impact 7-day Iceland route built around three regions that work extremely well together:
- Reykjavík (short start + hot pool)
- Golden Circle (geothermal + tectonic landscapes)
- South Coast to Jökulsárlón (waterfalls, black sand, glaciers)
- Snæfellsnes Peninsula (best “extra region” for one week)

**Overall time:** 7 days  
**Main focus:** waterfalls, geothermal scenery, black beaches, glaciers, coastal viewpoints  
**Best season:** May–June and September (good daylight, fewer crowds than peak, most services running)  
**Most crowded / expensive:** July–August  
**Winter note:** November–March can be quieter but short daylight and road/weather disruptions reduce freedom

    {
      title: 'Day 1 – Reykjavík (light day) + hot pool',
      content: `
Arrive in Reykjavík and keep the first day simple.

Ideas:
• Short city walk (harbour + central streets)
• One public pool / geothermal soak (budget-friendly compared to luxury spas)

Logistics:
• No car needed if you arrive late; you can pick it up the next morning.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 2 – Golden Circle (Þingvellir → Geysir → Gullfoss)',
      content: `
Classic geothermal + tectonic day.

Stops:
• Þingvellir (rift valley)
• Geysir area
• Gullfoss

Notes:
• Start early to avoid peak tour-bus timing.
• Roads are easy and paved.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 3 – South Coast to Vík (waterfalls + black sand)',
      content: `
Drive the South Coast and base around Vík.

Stops:
• Seljalandsfoss
• Skógafoss
• Reynisfjara / black-sand coast near Vík

Safety note (important):
• Reynisfjara can be dangerous due to “sneaker waves”.
• Follow local signs/closures and keep distance from the waterline.

This is one of the highest “views per day” segments in Iceland.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 4 – South Coast to Jökulsárlón (glacier lagoon day)',
      content: `
Long scenic day continuing east.

Core:
• Glacier tongue viewpoints (stop where visibility is good)
• Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon
• Diamond Beach nearby

Overnight:
• Ideally stay in the lagoon region to avoid turning the day into a rush.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 5 – Return west (choose one focus)',
      content: `
Return west with a flexible plan.

Option A (easy nature day):
• Canyon/lava-field style stops + slow pacing + fewer “must see” points

Option B (volcano / lava experience):
• Join a guided lava / volcano hike only if conditions are safe and routes are open.
• Always check official safety updates before committing.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 6 – Snæfellsnes Peninsula (best extra region)',
      content: `
Snæfellsnes works well in one day if you start early.

What it offers:
• Cliffs and lava fields
• Black beaches
• Coastal villages
• Iconic mountain viewpoints (Kirkjufell area)

Roads are generally easy, but weather can change quickly.

## Transportation

### Rental car
- Best option for the classic South Coast + Snæfellsnes loop.
- In late spring, summer, and early autumn, a small 2WD is usually sufficient for the paved main route in normal conditions.
- Avoid night driving outside Reykjavík (fatigue + weather changes).

### Multi-day guided tour (best for simplicity, often good for solo)
- Can be financially competitive for one traveler because it bundles transport + lodging.
- Downsides: fixed schedule, less freedom for quiet stops, and group pacing.

### Public transport
- Works within Reykjavík and for limited intercity movement.
- Not suitable for a flexible “stop every hour for waterfalls” road trip.

## Notes

- The core loop works best with flexible timing and early starts.
- The two most weather-sensitive segments are the South Coast (wind/rain) and Snæfellsnes (visibility + wind).
- If you travel in July–August, book accommodation and car early.
