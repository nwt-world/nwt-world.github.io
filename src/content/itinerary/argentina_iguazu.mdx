## Overview

A short, high-impact trip to Iguazú Falls: rainforest, huge water volume, and very simple logistics.

Default plan:
- 1 full day on the Argentina side (the “complete” park experience)
- optional Brazil side for panoramic views (can be done as a half-day or a full day)

**Province:** Misiones  
**Overall time:** 1–2 nights (add 1 more night if you want Brazil without rushing)  
**Main focus:** waterfalls, rainforest  
**Best season:** March–May, August–October (often less rain, better visibility)

Fly to Puerto Iguazú (IGR).

From the airport:
• Taxi / transfer (simplest)
• Local bus is also possible (limited frequency; check the terminal timetable)

Town plan:
• Short walk around the center
• Tres Fronteras viewpoint at sunset

Base:
• Puerto Iguazú is the base for both Argentina and Brazil sides.

      title: 'Iguazú National Park (Argentina side) – full day',
      content: `
This is the main day and the reason to come.

Park hours (official):
• Open daily 08:00–18:00
• Last entry 16:00
• Last train to Garganta del Diablo 15:30

Suggested order (easy pacing, high value):
1) Garganta del Diablo first (best light + fewer people early)
2) Upper and Lower walkways (different angles, easy paths)
3) Optional: Sendero Macuco (forest trail)

Getting there from Puerto Iguazú:
• Local bus from the terminal (most used option)
• Taxi / transfer (fixed prices, may be even cheaper for a group)

Inside the park:
• Trails are well-organized and mostly flat
• The train is part of the standard circulation

      title: 'Brazil side (optional) – day trip or overnight',
      content: `
Brazil side is about one thing: wide panoramic views of the entire waterfall system.

Option A — day trip from Puerto Iguazú (works well):
How to get there without a tour:
1) Bus from Puerto Iguazú bus terminal to Foz do Iguaçu (frequent daytime departures)
2) Border crossing: you must exit the bus for immigration on both sides, then re-board
3) In Foz, take the public bus line 120 (Parque Nacional–Aeroporto) from the TTU terminal to the Brazilian park entrance

Inside the Brazilian park:
• Shorter visit than the Argentina side
• The main trail is around 1.5 km with viewpoints ending at the big “in-the-mist” platform

Option B — overnight in Foz do Iguaçu (best if you have time):
• Cross in the afternoon, sleep in Foz
• Next morning: early park entry + calmer timing

Tours / transfers:
• If you prefer easy logistics, a half-day tour from Puerto Iguazú is the simplest format (border handling included).

## Notes

- The Argentina side is the “full day” park; the Brazil side is the “big panorama”.
- For Brazil day trips, border time is the main variable; leaving early makes the day smoother.
- Heat and humidity are normal; bring water and expect to get wet near the main platforms.
