## Overview

Bali is **not a relaxed or easy destination** and should not be approached as one.
It works best as a **short, carefully planned addition** to a Java or Komodo itinerary.

This route focuses on:
- volcanic landscapes and viewpoints,
- dramatic coastal scenery,
- good snorkeling locations,

and intentionally avoids:
- overcrowded and dirty beaches,
- nightlife-focused areas,
- renting bikes or cars.

Recommended duration: around 1 week.

      title: 'Sanur / Denpasar – Arrival & Transport Hub',
      content: `
Sanur is one of the most practical places to stay near Denpasar.

Why Sanur:
• Close to the airport
• Relatively calm compared to other coastal areas
• Main port for boats to Nusa Penida

Highlights:
• Long beachfront promenade
• Sunrise views (sunsets are better elsewhere)
• Basic but convenient infrastructure

Important transport note:
• Grab work reliably only around Denpasar and Sanur
• Outside this area, transport is controlled by local taxi groups

Recommended stay: 2-3 nights.
Sanur is primarily a logistics base, not a sightseeing destination.

    },
    {
      title: 'Nusa Penida – Dramatic Landscapes (Day Trip)',
      content: `
Nusa Penida is one of the most visually striking areas near Bali.

How to visit:

• Strongly recommended: organized day tour

Key sights:
• Kelingking Beach – iconic cliff formation
• Broken Beach – natural rock arch
• Angel’s Billabong – natural tidal pool
• Snorkeling near the islands

Important notes:
• Roads are very poor

Recommended approach:

`
    },
    {
      title: 'Ubud – Cultural Stop (Short Visit)',
      content: `
Ubud is the cultural center of Bali, but also one of the most crowded.

How to get there:
• Bus or shuttle from Sanur (they do exist)
• Private transfer if short on time

Highlights:
• Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary
• Tegallalang Rice Terraces
• Ubud Palace and central streets

Important:
• One day is enough

Recommended stay: day trip or 1 night maximum.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Kintamani & Mount Batur – Volcano Views',
      content: `
The Kintamani region offers Bali’s best volcanic scenery.

Highlights:
• Mount Batur – active volcano
• Lake Batur – large crater lake
• Caldera viewpoints around Kintamani village

How to visit:
• Guided tour is the most realistic option

Notes:
• Summit hikes are optional, not required
• Even viewpoints alone are worth the trip

Recommended: half-day or full-day tour from Ubud or Sanur.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Amed – Snorkeling & Mount Agung Views',
      content: `
Amed is one of the few calmer coastal areas in Bali.

Why Amed:
• Good snorkeling directly from the shore
• Views of Mount Agung
• Less nightlife, more relaxed atmosphere

How to get there:
• Limited bus connections
• Shuttle or pre-arranged transfer

Highlights:
• Coral reefs and fish close to the beach
• Volcanic black-sand coastline
• Quiet evenings

Recommended stay: 2–3 nights (infrastructure is very limited).
Amed works best as a deliberate escape from central Bali.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Gili Islands – Optional Extension',
      content: `
The Gili Islands can be reached most easily from Amed.

How to get there:
• Short boat transfer from Amed (shorter than from south Bali)

What to expect:
• Small islands with no cars
• Snorkeling and relaxed pace
• Still touristy, but calmer than much of Bali

This is optional and works best if you want a brief reset after Bali.
Recommended stay: 1 nights (only one boat to Amed per day).
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Return to Airport',
      content: `
From Amed, return to Denpasar airport.

How to get there:
• Pre-arranged transfer or
• Shuttle bus

Always plan buffer time.
Traffic and delays are common across the island.

## Transport reality (very important)

- Grab work **only near Denpasar and Sanur**
- Outside these areas:
  - transport is controlled by local taxi groups
  - prices are fixed and non-negotiable
- Renting bikes or cars is **not recommended** due to:
  - poor road conditions
  - aggressive policing and corruption
  - parking issues
  - theft risks

Best strategy:
- Pre-book transfers
- Use shuttles and guided tours
- Accept higher transport costs to reduce stress

---

## Expectations & costs

- Bali is **not cheap**
- Accommodation prices are high relative to quality
- Beaches often disappoint
- Planning time is significant

---

## Who this itinerary is for
- Travelers adding Bali **after Java or Komodo**
- Those interested in **volcano views and dramatic scenery**
- Snorkeling enthusiasts (Amed, Gili)

Bali is best treated as a **short, intentional stop**, not a long-term base.
When approached this way, it can still offer several genuinely impressive experiences.
