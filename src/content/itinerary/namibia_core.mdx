## Overview

Namibia offers some of Africa’s most dramatic and photogenic landscapes:
- Sossusvlei red dunes  
- Atlantic coast desert  
- Etosha wildlife  
- Remote mountain scenery  

It is one of Africa’s easiest countries for independent travel — but distances are large and planning is essential.

**Overall time:** 10–14 days  
**Main focus:** desert landscapes, wildlife, scenic drives  
**Best season:** May–October (dry season, best wildlife viewing)  
**Arrival airport:** Windhoek (WDH)

## Travel Logic

This itinerary requires either:

- A rented 4x4 vehicle for the entire route  
OR  
- A pre-booked multi-day guided tour covering all locations  

There is no practical public transport between Sossusvlei, Swakopmund, Etosha, and Damaraland.

You cannot rely on:
- Local buses between parks  
- Booking separate day tours from each location without having your own vehicle  
- Ride-hailing services (they do not exist outside Windhoek)  

### Option 1 – Self-Drive (Most Common)

Best for:
- 2–4 travelers (cost-efficient when shared)
- Flexible pacing
- Photography stops
- Wildlife viewing at your own rhythm

Requirements:
- 4x4 vehicle strongly recommended
- Advance accommodation bookings
- Comfort with gravel driving

This is the most popular and practical approach.

### Option 2 – Full Guided Tour

Best for:
- Solo travelers
- Travelers uncomfortable driving long distances
- Those wanting logistics fully handled

Important:
- Must be booked in advance
- Covers transport + accommodation + some meals
- Much more expensive for 2+ people

You cannot easily combine partial tours unless they are part of one organized circuit.
