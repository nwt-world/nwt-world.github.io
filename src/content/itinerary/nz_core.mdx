## Overview

A 10–14 day itinerary designed as a practical “two islands, no wasted driving” route:
- North Island for geothermal and volcanic scenery (Rotorua + Tongariro)
- South Island for fjords, alpine lakes, and big mountain viewpoints (Fiordland + Wānaka + Mt Cook + Tekapo)

Recommended flights:
- Arrive: Auckland (AKL)
- Depart: Queenstown (ZQN)

If your airline only supports round-trip to Auckland, add a final flight from Queenstown back to Auckland.

**Overall time:** 10–14 days  
**Main focus:** volcano scenery, viewpoints, day hikes, scenic drives  
**Best season:** November–March for stable hiking and long days; October/April can be quieter with good conditions

## Travel logic

- You need a car for the North Island segment (Rotorua and Tongariro are not practical without it).
- You fly to the South Island and rent a second car for the loop.
- Tongariro Alpine Crossing is point-to-point; you must book a shuttle.
- Milford Sound requires a cruise booking; the road to Milford is part of the day.

  days={[
    {
      title: 'Days 1–2 – Auckland (arrival base)',
      content: `
Base:
• Auckland (2 nights)

Why this base:
• Recovery from long-haul flight
• Easy logistics before picking up the car
• Simple waterfront walks without committing to another drive day

Suggested plan:
• Day 1: harbour walk + Devonport (ferry, easy)
• Day 2 morning: pick up rental car and depart south
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Days 2–3 – Rotorua (geothermal base)',
      content: `
Drive: Auckland → Rotorua (~3 hours)

Base:
• Rotorua (2 nights)

Why Rotorua:
• Best “high impact” geothermal landscapes with simple access
• Day trips are compact and do not require long drives once based here

Core stop:
• Wai-O-Tapu (geothermal pools and volcanic colours)

Car note:
• Car is effectively required for Wai-O-Tapu and surrounding geothermal sites
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Days 4–5 – Tongariro area (hike positioning base)',
      content: `
Drive: Rotorua → Tongariro region (~2.5 hours)

Base options:
• National Park Village (closest “trek base” feel)
• Tūrangi (more services, good access)

Why stay here:
• This positioning is for a low-stress Tongariro day (early start, correct shuttle timing)

Day hike:
• Tongariro Alpine Crossing (19 km)
• Shuttle booking required (one-way logistics)
• Do it only with a good forecast; conditions can change fast

Car note:
• Car is needed to reach the region
• Shuttle is needed for the hike itself
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 6 – Return to Auckland → fly to Queenstown',
      content: `
Drive: Tongariro region → Auckland Airport (allow ~4 hours total including buffer stops)

Logistics:
• Return North Island rental car at Auckland
• Fly Auckland → Queenstown
• Pick up South Island rental car in Queenstown

Why fly:
• Saves 1–2 full travel days vs ferrying and driving between islands
• Keeps the trip within 10–14 days without rushing
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Days 7–8 – Te Anau base + Milford Sound day',
      content: `
Drive: Queenstown → Te Anau (~2 hours)

Base:
• Te Anau (2 nights)

Why Te Anau:
• Best logistics for Milford Sound (shorter drive, earlier start)
• Avoids the extreme day length of a Queenstown-based bus day tour

Milford Sound day:
• Drive SH94 to Milford (plan many stops; the road is part of the experience)
• Cruise is the core activity (book ahead)
• Return to Te Anau

Road note:
• SH94 can close due to weather/works; check status before departure
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 9 – Te Anau → Wānaka (calmer lake base)',
      content: `
Drive: Te Anau → Wānaka (typically 4–5 hours depending on stops)

Base:
• Wānaka (1–2 nights)

Why Wānaka:
• Calm lake atmosphere and easy walks
• Good midpoint without backtracking

Optional hike note:
• Roys Peak is popular but demanding; do it only with stable weather and early start
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Days 10–11 – Aoraki / Mount Cook base (alpine views)',
      content: `
Drive: Wānaka → Aoraki / Mt Cook area via Lake Pukaki

Base:
• Mt Cook Village area (1–2 nights)

Why this base:
• Best “views per effort” alpine scenery
• Easy day hikes with major mountain views

Core walks:
• Hooker Valley Track (easy, check status)
• Tasman Glacier viewpoint areas

Transport note:
• This segment is car-dependent; there is no practical public transport for flexible hiking
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 12 – Lake Tekapo (short stop)',
      content: `
Drive: Mt Cook → Lake Tekapo (short transfer)

Base:
• Tekapo (1 night)

Why stop:
• Turquoise lake views
• Night sky conditions can be excellent if clear (stargazing is weather dependent)

This is a low-effort day between mountain areas.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Days 13–14 – Queenstown base + departure',
      content: `
Drive: Tekapo → Queenstown

Base:
• Queenstown (1–2 nights)

Why return:
• Practical departure airport
• Easy short drives with strong scenery

Easy options:
• Glenorchy scenic drive (high viewpoint value without long hikes)
• Short lakeside walks

Departure:
• Depart from Queenstown (ideal)
• If needed: fly Queenstown → Auckland for international departure

## Transportation

Car:
- Required for Rotorua, Tongariro positioning, and the South Island loop.
- Avoid night driving outside cities (fatigue, weather, wildlife).

Flights:
- Auckland → Queenstown is the key time-saver for a 10–14 day plan.
- If your flights are round-trip Auckland, add Queenstown → Auckland at the end.

Shuttles and bookings:
- Tongariro Alpine Crossing requires a shuttle booking (point-to-point hike).
- Milford Sound cruise should be booked ahead in peak months.

Tour alternatives:
- If you do not want to drive, you can do guided multi-day tours, but they trade away flexibility and quiet stops.

## Notes

- Two weather-critical days: Tongariro and Milford. If forecasts are poor, swap days rather than forcing it.
- If you need a tighter 10–11 day version, shorten by:
  - 1 night in Auckland, and
  - 1 night in Queenstown or Wānaka.
