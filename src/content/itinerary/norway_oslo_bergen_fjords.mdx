  days={[
    {
      title: 'Day 1 – Oslo',
      content: `
Easy route:
• Opera House exterior → waterfront → Akershus Fortress area

Museum pick:
• MUNCH (one large museum choice)
• Fram Museum (polar / expedition theme)
• Astrup Fearnley (small modern art)

Transport:
• Use Ruter (metro/tram/bus)
• Buy tickets in the Ruter app or ticket machines
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 2 – Oslo (optional) → night train to Bergen',
      content: `
Optional daytime add-on:
• Vigeland Park (open-air)

Then travel:
• Night train Oslo → Bergen (saves a hotel night)

Notes:
• Night trains are practical for logistics
• For views, the day train is better (night = mostly dark)
• Book sleeping options early in summer and on weekends
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 3 – Bergen (old harbor + one viewpoint)',
      content: `
Core:
• Bryggen (old harbor area)

Choose one viewpoint:
• Fløyen (easy funicular, short walks at the top)
• Ulriken (higher, more “mountain” feel)

Transport:
• Bergen city transport is straightforward; tickets via Skyss
• Most sights are walkable from central areas
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 4 – Bergen → Myrdal → Flåm → Aurland',
      content: `
This is the main scenic transfer day.

Route logic:
• Bergen Line to Myrdal (daytime for scenery)
• Flåm Railway down to Flåm
• Short local connection to Aurland (bus/taxi depending on timing)

Base:
• Aurland is calmer
• Flåm is more of a transport hub with higher day-trip traffic

Booking notes:
• Flåm Railway seats can sell out in peak season
• Plan the day around timetable connections (use Entur)
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 5 – Nærøyfjord / Aurlandsfjord cruise + slow evening',
      content: `
Main fjord day.

Core:
• Fjord cruise on Nærøyfjord / Aurlandsfjord (Flåm ⇄ Gudvangen variations)
• Choose a cruise that fits your transport plan (one-way or round trip)

Notes:
• Cruises run year-round, but frequency varies by season
• Weather affects the experience less than mountains (fjord scenery still works in clouds)
• Keep evening slow in Aurland or Flåm
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 6 – Fjord viewpoints / short hikes',
      content: `
Buffer day for bad weather in fjord region.
Also works for short trails and viewpoints close to the fjord.
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 7 – Return to Oslo (train or flight) → depart',
      content: `
Return to Oslo.

Options:
• Day train (scenic if you travel in daylight)
• Flight (faster)

## Transportation

Norway is one of the easiest countries to do by public transport.

Planning:
- Use Entur for door-to-door planning across train, bus, metro, tram, ferry.
- For long-distance rail (Oslo–Bergen), book via Vy.

Key notes:
- Daytime trains are the scenic option; night trains are the hotel-saving option.
- Flåm Railway and fjord cruises should be booked early in high season.
- The Flåm/Aurland region works well without a car if you plan around timetables.

## Notes

- For the calm version, keep Flåm/Aurland at 2 nights minimum.
- The best “views-per-effort” are: one Bergen viewpoint + one fjord cruise + one short hike day.
- If you travel in July–August, book trains and Flåm/Aurland accommodation early.
