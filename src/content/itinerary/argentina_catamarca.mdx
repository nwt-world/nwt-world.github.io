## Overview

Catamarca’s Ruta de los Seismiles is one of Argentina’s most extreme landscapes that is still realistically visitable without technical climbing:
a paved high-Andes road (RN60), 6000 m+ volcano views, and high-altitude lagoons.

This is a niche itinerary with real planning requirements:
- base in Fiambalá or Tinogasta (4 nights)
- day trips are 4x4 excursion days (remote, no services)
- altitude hits 4,500–5,000 m on the main viewpoints

The altitude gain is slow if you follow this structure:
Catamarca city (~500 m) → Tinogasta (~1,200 m) / Fiambalá (~1,500 m) → Termas (~1,750 m) → Seismiles viewpoints (4,500 m+).

**Province:** Catamarca  
**Overall time:** 6 days / 5 nights  
**Main focus:** extreme landscapes, volcano viewpoints, high-altitude lagoons  
**Best season:** April–November (dry season). Avoid the core winter months for the highest road days due to closures and snow risk.

    {
      title: 'Arrival: Catamarca city (1 night buffer)',
      content: `
Arrive to San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca.

Why this night matters:
• You travel to Fiambalá/Tinogasta in daylight next day
• It keeps the altitude progression gentle

Simple city plan:
• Compact center walk
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Transfer to Fiambalá or Tinogasta',
      content: `
Move west to the Seismiles gateway area.

How to get there:
• Long-distance bus (search schedules and book if available)
• Private transfer (useful if bus times don’t match)

Where to base:
• Fiambalá: closer to Termas and the Seismiles access road, usually the most practical
• Tinogasta: slightly larger town feel and services; still works well
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Termas de Fiambalá (lower-altitude recovery day)',
      content: `
A calm day before the very high-altitude outings.

Altitude:
• Termas are around 1,750 m

How it works:
• Short transfer from Fiambalá area
• Multiple stone pools with different temperatures
• This day is useful for rest

Optional add-on if you still want something active:
• Short viewpoint stops on the way back
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Ruta de los Seismiles',
      content: `
This is the core day: high-altitude road scenery, volcano silhouettes, and lagoons.

Typical structure (varies by operator and conditions):
• Early departure in 4x4
• RN60 scenic drive with multiple stops
• High-altitude lagoons (often includes Laguna Verde / Laguna Azul stops)

Altitude:
• Expect long periods above 4,000 m
• Highest stops often reach ~4,500 m+ depending on the route
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Balcón del Pissis',
      content: `
The signature viewpoint day of the region.

What it is:
• A high panoramic balcony with views over multiple colored lagoons and massive volcano backdrops

Altitude:
• The viewpoint is above 4,700 m (very thin air)

How it usually runs:
• Early departure in 4x4
• Limited time at the highest point (wind + altitude)
• Slow pacing is normal and expected
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Return to Catamarca city (same route back)',
      content: `
Return from Tinogasta/Fiambalá back to Catamarca city.

Most realistic options:
• Bus back (daytime schedule dependent)
• Transfer back if schedules don’t align

If you fly out same day:
• Keep a large buffer; bus delays happen.
