## Overview

Nosy Be is the easiest “island base” in Madagascar — and it feels very different from the classic Indian Ocean destinations.

Compared to places like the Maldives / Seychelles / Mauritius / Zanzibar, Nosy Be is:
- more remote and less polished
- more “wild” in atmosphere (simple infrastructure, fewer services)
- more focused on nature add-ons beyond beaches (lemurs, rainforest, seasonal whales)

Why go:
- You want a tropical island stay, but with a visible “Madagascar character”
- You want easy day trips that add uniqueness (turtles, lemurs, small-island hopping)
- You’ve already visited the more mainstream islands and want something different

Flights & access:
- Nosy Be has its own airport (NOS), but direct international connections are limited.
- Many itineraries route via Addis Ababa (Ethiopian Airlines) and/or via Réunion (Air Austral). Some routes can be seasonal.

**Region:** Northwest Madagascar  
**Base:** Nosy Be  
**Overall time:** 5–10 days  
**Main focus:** snorkeling, small islands, light wildlife  
**Best season:** May–November (drier); whales are seasonal (July–September)

A second snorkeling day works well here because sea conditions can vary.

Why add it:
