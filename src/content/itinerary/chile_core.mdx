## Best season

Chile’s climate varies greatly by region.

General guidance:
- **October–April**: best overall window for most regions
- **Summer (Dec–Feb)**: best for the south, very hot in the Atacama
- **Winter (Jun–Aug)**: snow in the Andes, limited access to some areas

Easter Island is warm year-round, but flights are more expensive in peak season.
