## Overview

Aruba is one of the safest and most organized Caribbean islands.
It is more expensive than Belize or Curaçao, but infrastructure is significantly easier.

It works well for:  
- A short, predictable beach vacation  
- A relaxed remote-work stay  

**Overall time:** 5–7 days  
**Main focus:** beaches, snorkeling, light exploration  
**Best season:** December–August (outside peak hurricane belt)  
**Arrival airport:** Queen Beatrix International Airport (AUA)

No car is required, but renting one adds flexibility.
