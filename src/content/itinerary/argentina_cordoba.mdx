## Overview

A calm and flexible visit to Córdoba (Argentina’s second-largest city),
combined with nearby mountain villages founded by European settlers.

- culture without overplanning
- calm villages and short walks
- using Córdoba as a transport hub

**Province:** Córdoba  
**Overall time:** 3–6 days  
**Main focus:** culture, villages, relaxed nature  
**Best season:** March–May, September–November (doable year-round)
