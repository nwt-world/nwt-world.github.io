## Overview

This itinerary covers the *main inhabited islands of the Seychelles* and is designed for travelers who value
*nature, tranquility, and flexibility* over rushed sightseeing.

The route is structured **by islands**, with suggested time ranges rather than a strict day-by-day plan.
You can shorten or extend each part depending on your total trip length, budget, and preferred pace.

**Islands covered**:
- Mahé
- Cerf Island (optional side stay from Mahé)
- Praslin
- La Digue

This itinerary does not include private resort islands (such as Frégate Island or Silhouette Island). While beautiful, they are relatively small and expensive, and are better visited *in addition to* the main islands, which offer far more variety in landscapes, activities, and independent exploration.

## Mahé Island
**Recommended stay:** *3–6 days*

Mahé is the largest island and the main gateway to the Seychelles. It is home to the international airport,
the capital city, and a surprisingly diverse landscape — from granite mountains to long white-sand beaches.

### Highlights
- **Beaches**:
  - *Port Launay, Anse Soleil* — excellent for snorkeling
  - *Anse Intendance, Petite Anse, Police Bay, Grand Anse* — wild and photogenic beaches
  - *Anse Royale, Beau Vallon* — good for swimming, more infrastructure
- **Hiking & viewpoints**:
  - Morne Blanc Trail, Copolia Trail — short hikes with panoramic views
- **Victoria**:
  - Small but lively capital with markets, colonial architecture, and the main bus and ferry terminals

### Getting around
- **Rental car** – the most flexible option, especially for beaches and viewpoints
- **Public buses** – very affordable and scenic, though slow (check updated timetables)

### Side trips from Mahé
- **Cerf Island** (possible as a day trip or a multi-day stay)
- **St. Anne Marine Park** for snorkeling and boat excursions

Mahé works well both as a **base island** and as a destination in its own right.

---

## Cerf Island
**Recommended stay:** *1–3 days (optional)*

Often overlooked in classic itineraries, **Cerf Island** is a quiet escape just a 10-minute boat ride from Mahé.
It is ideal if Mahé’s beaches feel too busy — here you can take a kayak and easily find a beach entirely to yourself.

### Why include Cerf
- Calm atmosphere and practically empty beaches
- Excellent snorkeling directly from the shore
- Small enough to explore on foot or by kayak

### Highlights
- Coral reefs with rich marine life
- Secluded beaches accessible by kayak
- Quiet evenings and minimal infrastructure

### How to get there
- **Boat transfers from Mahé**, usually arranged by hotels

**Note:** Cerf is not a budget destination, but it is well worth a few nights for a slow and tranquil Seychelles experience.

---

## Praslin Island
**Recommended stay:** *2–4 days*

Praslin combines **iconic beaches** with unique inland nature and feels more compact and relaxed than Mahé.

### Highlights
- **Vallée de Mai (UNESCO)** — home of the legendary Coco de Mer palms
- **Beaches**: Anse Lazio and Anse Georgette — among the most photographed beaches in the world
- Gentle coastal scenery and calm swimming spots

### Getting around
- **Rental car** – the fastest way to reach beaches and viewpoints
- **Public buses** – generally easier to use than on Mahé

### How to get there
- **Ferry from Mahé** (most common option)
- **Domestic flight** (faster and more expensive, but offers scenic views)

### Side trips
- Boat excursions to **Curieuse Island** (giant tortoises and coastal walks)

---

## La Digue Island
**Recommended stay:** *1–4 days (depending on total trip duration)*

La Digue is small, quiet, and visually iconic. Many travelers rush through it,
but it rewards those who stay longer with a **deep sense of calm**.

### Highlights
- **Anse Source d’Argent** — granite boulders and shallow turquoise waters
- Giant tortoise enclosures
- Wild southern beaches (some require hiking):
  Grand Anse, Petite Anse, Anse Cocos, Anse Caiman, Anse Marron
- Quiet east-coast beaches with strong tides — ideal for relaxation rather than swimming

### Getting around
- **Bicycles** – the primary and most enjoyable mode of transport
- Very limited car traffic and a relaxed island rhythm

### How to get there
- **Ferry from Praslin**
- Direct ferries from Mahé (less frequent)
- **Helicopter from Mahé** — significantly more expensive

While one day is enough for the main highlights and many people visit La Digue as a day trip from Mahé or Praslin,
**3–4 days** allow you to discover its quieter corners and experience what is often considered the most
"classic Seychelles" atmosphere.
