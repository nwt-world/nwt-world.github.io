## Overview

Iberá is one of Argentina’s best wildlife destinations: capybaras, caimans, marsh deer, monkeys (in some areas), and exceptional birdlife.
The calmest and most practical base is Colonia Carlos Pellegrini (Laguna Iberá portal), where activities are mostly done by boat and with local guides.

Recommended structure:
- 1 night in Corrientes or Resistencia (logistics buffer)
- 3 nights in Colonia Carlos Pellegrini (2 full days of excursions)

**Province:** Corrientes  
**Overall time:** 4–5 days  
**Main focus:** wildlife, boat safaris, lagoons, calm nature  
**Best season:** April–June and August–October (pleasant temperatures, easier outdoors). Summer is hotter with more insects and storms.

      title: 'Day 1 – Arrival to Corrientes or Resistencia (1 night)',
      content: `
Arrive to:
• Corrientes (CNQ) or Resistencia (RES)

Plan:
• 1 night in Corrientes city (nice riverside promenade) or Resistencia (logistics only)

If you land in RES:
• Corrientes is nearby across the bridge; transfers and local buses are commonly used between the two cities.
• Choose whichever side has the better flight timing.

This night is a buffer so you can travel to Iberá in daylight.

      title: 'Day 2 – Bus to Mercedes → lodge transfer → Carlos Pellegrini (start wetlands stay)',

Morning:
• Long-distance bus to Mercedes (Corrientes)

From Mercedes to Colonia Carlos Pellegrini:
• Pre-arranged lodge transfer is the simplest option
• The final section is on rural roads; travel time depends on conditions

Key rule:
• Arrange the Mercedes → Pellegrini transfer before arrival (your lodge can usually coordinate timing with the bus).
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Days 3–4 – Iberá activities (2 full days)',
      content: `
Most lodges run a similar rhythm:
• Early morning activity (best wildlife light)
• Midday rest (heat/insects)
• Late afternoon/sunset activity

Typical activities from Carlos Pellegrini:
• Boat safari on Laguna Iberá (capybaras, caimans, birds)
• Canoe / kayak outing (quiet and slow, excellent for birds)
• Short guided walks on trails/boardwalks near the village and lagoon edges
• Night safari (often focused on caimans, night birds, and sounds)
ы
Lodges usually sell activities as:
• full-board + excursions package, or
• accommodation + excursions booked per outing
`
    },
    {
      title: 'Day 5 – Return to Mercedes → Corrientes/Resistencia → depart',
      content: `
Transfer back to Mercedes (pre-arranged).

Then:
• Bus to Corrientes/Resistencia
• Same-day flight is possible if timings align, but allow buffer time.
• If schedules are tight, add one extra night in Corrientes/Resistencia.
