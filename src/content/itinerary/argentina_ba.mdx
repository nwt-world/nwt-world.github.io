## Optional Evening Program (Cultural)

Buenos Aires has one of the richest cultural scenes in South America.
If you enjoy arts and music, consider adding evening activities to your stay.

Options:
- **Concerts & theatre** – classical music, opera, ballet, and contemporary performances
  (booking in advance is strongly recommended, especially on weekends)

  Choose a professional show or a smaller venue; tourist-oriented but culturally iconic

These activities work well as an evening contrast after daytime city walks.
