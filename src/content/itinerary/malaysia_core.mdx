      title: 'Borneo (Kota Kinabalu) – Nature & Wildlife',

• Tunku Abdul Rahman Marine Park – small islands near the city for snorkeling and day trips

Wildlife experiences:
• River safaris to see proboscis monkeys
• Orangutan rehabilitation centers (with ethical considerations)
• Night wildlife and firefly-watching along mangrove rivers

Recommended stay: 4–7 days.
Borneo rewards travelers who enjoy nature and slower-paced exploration.

How to get there:
• Domestic flight from Kuala Lumpur or other Malaysian cities

    {
      title: 'Optional Side Trip – Brunei',
      content: `
Brunei is a small sultanate on the island of Borneo and can be visited as a short side trip from Kota Kinabalu.

Why visit:
• Quiet atmosphere and very low crowds
• Impressive mosques and Islamic architecture
• Traditional water villages (Kampong Ayer)

How to get there:
• Short flight from Kota Kinabalu
• Overland route involving road travel and ferry (longer)

Recommended stay: 1–2 days.
Brunei works best as a brief cultural contrast rather than a main destination.

## Best season

Malaysia is generally travelable year-round, but conditions vary by region.

General notes:
- **December–March**: good for Langkawi and western Malaysia
- **April–September**: generally better for Borneo (Sabah)
- Rain usually comes in short, intense showers rather than all-day storms

There is **no single perfect season** — choosing the right region matters more than timing.
