## Overview

A compact, scenic trip to Mendoza at the foothills of the Andes — the main gateway to Aconcagua, the highest mountain in the Americas.

- a 3–5 day standalone Andes trip
- a connection point for the classic overland route to Chile (Paso Los Libertadores)

**Province:** Mendoza  
**Overall time:** 3–5 days  
**Main focus:** Andes scenery, viewpoints, mountain roads  
**Best season:** October–April for the High Andes road; winter is calmer but weather can affect mountain access
