## Overview

Northern Vietnam is the most **dramatic and atmospheric** region of the country.
It is defined by **mountains, limestone karsts, historic cities, and cooler temperatures**.

This region is less suitable for beach-focused travel and more rewarding for:
- nature and landscape lovers
- cultural exploration
- slow and contemplative journeys

Weather here is more extreme than in central or southern Vietnam:
- **Winters** can be cold and misty
- **Summers** bring heat and heavy rains, especially in the mountains
