      title: 'Other Emirates – Optional Extensions',
      content: `
If time allows, consider visiting other emirates for a different perspective.

Sharjah:
• Strong focus on culture and museums
• Traditional architecture
• Easily reachable from Dubai

Ajman:
• Quiet beaches
• Less developed and more local atmosphere

Ras Al Khaimah:
• Mountains and desert landscapes
• Hiking and viewpoints
• Better suited if you have a car

These emirates are less touristic and often more affordable than central Dubai.
